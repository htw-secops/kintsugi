/// <summary>
/// Installable kintsugi-agent builds. The read routes are deliberately not gated behind
/// <see cref="Filters.RequireAgentIdentityAttribute"/> like host/application registration is — the
/// listing and download routes need to work from a plain browser (the Clients page) and from an
/// agent that hasn't necessarily enrolled yet, and the package content itself is authenticated by
/// its own signature (see <see cref="AgentPackageDto.Sha256Signature"/>), not by who's asking for it.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// That reasoning covers reading only. <see cref="Publish"/> carries
/// <see cref="RequireAdminSessionAttribute"/>, because publishing is what the signed checksum
/// vouches for: the handler signs whatever was uploaded with the key every agent pins, so the
/// signature says nothing about who uploaded it, and the route itself has to. And
/// <see cref="Download"/> writes the live enrollment token into an archive only for a caller the
/// same rule accepts (<see cref="RequireAdminSessionAttribute.IsAdministrator"/>); anyone else
/// gets the package exactly as published, with the blank token it was built with. Both were
/// anonymous until a penetration test of a live deployment pointed them out.
