// There is deliberately no redirecting sign-in gate here any more, and it is worth saying why so
// one does not come back.
//
// This app used to serve the admin UI itself as Razor Pages, so a middleware could answer a page
// request with a 302 — to /settings/authentication on a server with nothing configured, or to
// /account/login when sign-in was required and the caller had no cookie. The admin UI is now a
// Flutter web application served as static files by nginx (see nginx/default.conf and
// nginx/Dockerfile), so that page request never arrives here at all: there is nothing left under
// this app's routes but /api, /swagger, /health and the two OIDC callbacks, and redirecting any of
// those would break them — /signin-oidc in particular has to be reachable by a caller who is, by
// definition, not signed in yet.
//
// The three jobs that middleware did are now split, and all three need to stay:
//
//   * "nothing configured yet, lock everything to the authentication screen" and "sign-in required
//     and you have no cookie" are reported as data by GET /api/session, which the client fetches
//     before it renders anything and routes on. See SessionController — that route is anonymous by
//     design, and is the only new one that is.
//   * refusing the individual browser-driven /api routes is [RequireAdminSession], per controller.
//     That attribute mirrors this gate's semantics exactly (required precisely when an
//     administrator has saved AuthenticationSettings and enabled it) rather than inventing a second
//     shape that could drift from it.
//   * handing off to the identity provider is GET /api/auth/challenge, a full-page navigation the
//     client's sign-in button targets.
//
// The consequence to hold onto: /api is still exempt from any framework-level authentication here,
// so a browser-driven route added without [RequireAdminSession] is anonymous. Nothing else will
// stop it.
