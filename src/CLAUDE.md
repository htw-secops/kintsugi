# The backend (`src/`, `tests/`)

Loaded when Claude reads files under `src/`. The root `CLAUDE.md` carries what applies before you
get here: the two-layer agent authentication, `[RequireAdminSession]` on every browser-driven route,
the `/api/admin/` prefix, and the version bump every commit touching `src/` owes.

## Architecture

Layering is conventional (`Domain` ← `Application` ← `Infrastructure` ← `WebApi`) with MediatR
command/query handlers, each feature folder holding a `Command`/`Handler`/`Validator` triad;
FluentValidation runs via `ValidationBehaviour`. What follows is the part no single file explains.

**Two separate key hierarchies, kept apart on purpose.** `CaService` mints agent identities;
`ArtifactSigningService` signs script/command *content*. An AI-generated or hand-pasted script
starts **unsigned** — a human must sign it via `POST /api/upgrade-paths/sign-script`, and the agent
verifies against the signing pubkey it pinned at enrollment before executing anything. Do not make
generation sign automatically.


Every anonymous route is now closed. `AiSettingsController`, `DeploymentsController` and
`PatchesController` carry the attribute **on the class**, because nothing on them is an agent route
and the recurring failure is a route added later inheriting no gate; `HostsController` and
`UpgradePathsController` are mixed, so theirs is per-action. Two routes were removed rather than
gated, because neither could be secured as it stood:

- `POST /api/upgrade-paths/report-version` set `LatestVersion` fleet-wide for any (application,
  platform), which drives `updateAvailable`, which drives the agent's `is_patchable` — so anyone
  could suppress patching across the fleet by posting the installed version as the latest one. It
  could not take `[RequireAgentIdentity]`, because its body carried no serial number for the filter
  to compare `X-Agent-Cert-Cn` against, and no agent called it. It is redundant besides: the
  update-check coordinator already re-runs each script's own `--update-version` on the server. If it
  returns it needs a `serialNumber`, the attribute, and an entry in nginx's regex.
- `PUT /api/patching-policy` was *not* anonymous — it sits inside nginx's exact-match regex, so a
  client certificate was required. That was the problem: it carried no `[RequireAgentIdentity]` and
  no admin gate, so **any enrolled agent could rewrite the fleet-wide patching policy**, while a
  browser could not reach it at all. Nothing legitimate called it — at the time the Settings page
  dispatched `UpdatePatchingPolicySettingsCommand` through `ISender`, and all three agents only ever
  `GET` this path (`policy.rs`). The `GET` stays; it is what agents poll. The write now lives at
  `PUT /api/admin/settings/patching-policy`, outside that regex and carrying
  `[RequireAdminSession]`, which is exactly where `PatchingPolicyController`'s own note said such a
  route belongs.

Still anonymous by design, and correctly so: `POST /api/host/enroll` (an unenrolled agent has no
certificate; the enrollment token is what protects it — and it is the one route with a rate limit,
`EnrollmentRateLimit`, per source address) and the *reads* under `/api/agent-packages` (a
self-updating agent has to see what is published before proving anything, and the download is
protected by a signed checksum instead). Two things under that prefix are not anonymous, and a
penetration test is what found them: `POST /api/agent-packages` carries `[RequireAdminSession]`,
because the handler signs the uploaded checksum with the key every agent pins — the signature
proves the bytes passed through this server, so the route has to prove who sent them; and
`Download` writes the live enrollment token into the archive only for a caller
`RequireAdminSessionAttribute.IsAdministrator` accepts, with everyone else getting the package as
published. That static is the one rule in two places on purpose — use it rather than re-deriving
the gate's semantics. `/swagger` is also exempt from the sign-in gate, so the route listing is
readable anonymously — disclosure only, but worth knowing.

`GET /api/applications` was a third removal of the `report-version` kind: inside the regex, so it
needed a certificate, but a bodiless read gives `[RequireAgentIdentity]` nothing to compare the CN
against, so any one agent's certificate read the whole fleet's inventory with host names. Nothing
called it — the agents only `POST` the path and the UI reads `/api/admin/applications`.

`PublishAgentPackageCommandValidator` restricts `FileName` to a bare name
(`^[A-Za-z0-9_-][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$`), and `AgentPackageFileStorage.RequireBareName` checks again
before touching the disk: the name is joined onto the platform directory, and `Path.Combine` will
follow `..` or discard everything before a rooted segment. Both layers, because the storage class
is reached from the import as well as the publish.


**Removing a host is two-phase, and the soft-deleted row still owns its name.** The Hosts screen's
delete is a *request*: `RequestHostRemoval` sets `DeletedAtUtc` (so the host vanishes from the list
at once) and `RemovalRequested` (so the next check-in response tells the agent to uninstall itself).
The row is hard-deleted only when the agent confirms via `POST /api/host-removed`. An agent that
cannot authenticate never confirms — and cannot even *learn* it should uninstall, since both routes
are inside nginx's client-certificate regex — so the row lingers forever, invisible but still
holding `Hostname` and `SerialNumber` in unique indexes.

That is not hypothetical: it deadlocked a Windows host whose identity write was failing. Re-register
under a *different* serial (a re-imaged machine, or one whose serial moved between rungs of
`choose_serial_number`) and `CreateHostCommandHandler` — which looks up by serial number only —
inserts, collides on `IX_hosts_Hostname`, and returns a bare 500 whose only clue is a constraint
name in the server log, on a route agents call unattended every hour. So `ReclaimHostnameAsync` now
hard-deletes a **removed** row whose name is being claimed (installed applications go with it;
`installed_applications` cascades on `HostId`), and a name held by a **live** host raises
`ConflictException` → 409 rather than deleting either record on an agent's say-so. Keep that split.
The reclaim is deliberately reachable only when no row matched the reported serial, which is what
leaves the ordinary removal flow intact: a host coming back under its *own* serial still matches
above, still carries `RemovalRequested`, and is still told to uninstall rather than resurrected.


**Script approval is shared through a GitHub repository, and the default branch is the trust root.**
Signing a script is effective locally at once — the human at the console reviewed it — and *also*
opens a pull request against `SCRIPT_APPROVAL_GITHUB_REPO` carrying the script, its metadata and the
signature (`GitHubScriptApprovalPublisher`). The pull request is a **record and a distribution
channel, not a gate**: it is raised after `SaveChangesAsync`, and every failure mode is reported
rather than thrown, because a GitHub outage must not stop a reviewed script from patching the fleet
it was reviewed for. The layout is content-addressed —
`approved-scripts/<sha256>/{<name>.sh|<name>.ps1, metadata.json, signatures/<fingerprint>.json}` —
because a package-manager script is byte-identical for every application that manager handles, so
one review covers all of them (the same reason `FindExistingSignatureForScriptAsync` matches on
content), and because one signature *file per signer* means two servers approving the same bytes
never touch the same path and so never conflict. `.gitattributes` exempts `approved-scripts/**` from
`text=auto eol=lf`: normalizing a PowerShell script's CRLF would change its hash and invalidate
every signature over it.

**An entry is published as what it is, not as the row somebody happened to sign.** The row a human
presses "Sign Script" on is one application's; a package-manager script is every application's. So
`ApprovedScriptIdentity` decides what the metadata, the commit message, the pull request title and
the filename say: a package-manager entry is `homebrew.sh` / `winget.ps1` / `flatpak.sh` — one per
manager, the manager's own row included — and is labelled for the manager (never *as* the manager —
`Homebrew` would match the manager's own row in the adoption offer), with `ApplicationIdentifier`
dropped because whichever application the reviewer was looking at says nothing about a script all of
them share; an AI-researched entry keeps the application's own name and is filed under its identifier
(`com.nextcloud.desktopclient.sh`, `Mozilla.Firefox.ps1`). Whether an entry is the manager's script
is decided by comparing bytes against `BuildScript()`, not by trusting the row.
The filename is **not** load-bearing: `ApprovedScriptCorpus.ScriptPathsIn` finds the script by
extension and confirms it by hash, which is what keeps entries written under the original fixed
`script.sh` readable. One consequence to hold onto: a generic package-manager entry matches no local
row's name, so those entries are **bless-only** — correctly, since this server generates those exact
bytes itself and `ImportApprovedScriptsFromSourceCommandHandler`'s content-match bless already covers
them. Adoption is for AI-researched scripts, where matching on name is exactly right.

**A pull request is raised for new content only, and "already approved" is decided by the entry, not
the signature.** `GitHubScriptApprovalPublisher` first asks whether
`approved-scripts/<sha256>/metadata.json` exists on the default branch, and if it does, signing
reports `AlreadyApproved` and writes nothing — whichever server's signature the entry carries. Once
the bytes are on the trust root they are approved for every server reading it; a second server
signing them locally is doing what a bless does (re-signing approved content with its own key so its
own agents can verify it), and a bless raises no pull request. The check used to compare this
signer's signature *document* against the one on the branch, and that never matched: an ECDSA
signature is randomised per signing and the document carries `SignedAtUtc`, so every re-sign of an
already-merged script — the Homebrew script taken from a newer build and signed on a second server,
say — opened a pull request rewriting one signature file. Do not put a document comparison back; the
`signatures/<fingerprint>.json`-per-signer layout still exists so two servers approving the same
*new* bytes at the same time never conflict, not so that every server publishes its attestation.

**A remote signature is never served to an agent — the importing server re-signs.** Each agent pins
exactly one signing key at enrollment: its own server's. So the Upgrade Scripts screen's "Refresh
scripts" verifies the upstream signature and then signs the same bytes with the **local** key. That
is why this feature needed no change to any of the three agents. Two halves, split on whether
content arrives: *blessing* a local script whose bytes are already approved upstream is automatic
and safe to be (nothing new arrives — it is `SignUpgradePathScriptCommandHandler`'s sibling-row
propagation extended across servers), while *adopting* content this server does not have is a
per-row button a human presses, with the signer's fingerprint beside it.

**Be precise about what verifying an approval proves.** The signer's public key travels in the same
repository as the script it vouches for, so anyone able to write there can edit a script, mint a
fresh keypair, and produce an entry that verifies perfectly. Verification establishes that an entry
is internally consistent and names its signer — *not* that the signer was authorized. Authorization
is the repository's branch protection on the default branch, and nothing else. The one genuinely
verified case is a fingerprint equal to `GetPublicKeyFingerprint()`: a signature this server made,
against a key that never left its private volume. Do not write comments or UI copy that upgrade this
to "verified"; the screen says so plainly and should keep doing so. The consequence worth holding onto:
**a merge to that repository is enough to offer new executable content to every server that
refreshes**, which is why adoption is not automatic, why adoption refuses a row that already carries
a signature (agents may be running it), and why `ScriptLanguages.For` must agree on both sides — a
genuinely-signed `#!/bin/bash` script reaching a PowerShell host is exactly the failure the shared
`generic` bucket used to permit.


**A GitHub App can stand in for both GitHub tokens, and it does so in exactly one place.**
Settings > GitHub can create an App for this server through GitHub's manifest flow
(`GitHubAppController`: `manifest` → GitHub → `callback` → GitHub's install page → `installed`).
Once it is connected *and installed*, `GitHubSettingsProvider` mints an installation token in place
of each stored token, and none of the five consumers changed — that seam is the whole design. Four
things are load-bearing:

- **The two tokens stay two scopes.** `GitHubTokenScope.ReadOnly` (`contents:read`, every
  repository the installation reaches) replaces `ApiToken`; `GitHubTokenScope.ApprovalWrite`
  (`contents:write` + `pull_requests:write`, restricted by *name* to the approval repository)
  replaces `ScriptApprovalToken`. GitHub lets a token be minted narrower than its installation, and
  that is what keeps `.claude/rules/script-approval-repo.md` true with one App behind both — the AI
  research and agent-package clients still never hold write access.
- **A failed mint is null, never an exception and never a fallback.** Null is already a supported
  state for each token (anonymous reads; "signing approves locally and raises no pull request"), so
  the Upgrade Scripts page reports it honestly, and the Settings page — needed to fix the App —
  stays up. The stored personal tokens are deliberately *not* fallen back to: an installed App that
  is failing must be seen to fail.
- **Nothing on a redirect is taken on trust.** The manifest leg's `state` is a time-limited Data
  Protection payload only this server can mint, so a `callback` carrying someone else's code is
  refused; the installation id is confirmed by asking GitHub, *as the App*, about it
  (`IGitHubAppClient.GetInstallationAccountAsync`) before it is stored. Both redirect targets carry
  `[RequireAdminSession]` with the rest of the controller — they are top-level navigations, so the
  `SameSite=Lax` session cookie rides along — and report failure by redirecting to the Settings
  page with `githubAppError`, since the browser is mid-navigation and a JSON body would be the page
  left on screen.
- **An installation token reaches only the account the App is installed on.** An approval
  repository owned by a different account than the App makes every write mint fail; the Settings
  page says so in red rather than leaving it to a log line.

`GitHubAppTokenProvider` is a singleton cache beside a transient typed client for the reason
`VantaAccessTokenProvider` is, keyed on (App, installation, scope, a hash of the key) so reconnecting
or changing the approval repository invalidates the right entries without anything remembering to.
The App's private key is stored as written, like the tokens beside it: GitHub shows it once, at
conversion, and this database is then the only copy.


**The admin UI is a separate client, and everything it needs is a REST route.** It used to be
Razor Pages that injected `ISender` and dispatched MediatR handlers directly, so most screens had no
API at all. It is now a Flutter web application in `web/`, compiled by `nginx/Dockerfile` and served
as static files by nginx — see web/CLAUDE.md.


## AI providers: protocols, not providers

**A provider is configuration; a protocol is code.** `AiProvider.Routed` routes each `AiFeature`
(script research, script repair, CPE suggestion) to an `AiConnection` and a model, and a connection
is a wire protocol (`AiWireProtocol`: OpenAI chat/completions, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages,
Gemini, Ollama), an endpoint and a credential. Connections are picked from the models.dev catalog
(`ModelsDevCatalog` — 226 providers, cached in `ai_catalog_cache`) or entered as a custom endpoint,
so LiteLLM, vLLM, OpenRouter, Groq, Azure and Vertex need no code. The shape is NightMail's AI
subsystem (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-26-ai-subsystem-design.md` there), ported. Four things
are load-bearing:

- **One engine, and the original providers run on it.** `AiEngine` drives every protocol's
  adapter through one tool loop. Anthropic, OpenAI and Ollama became fixed routes
  (`AiUpgradePathResearchClient.LegacyRoute`) with their old model defaults, hosted search and
  output ceilings, and `AiUpgradePathResearchClientTests` — written against the hand-written
  clients — passes against it with only its constructor changed. Goose and the Claude Agent SDK are agents that run their
  own loops and stay outside it.
- **Web access is one rule for every protocol.** Research uses the provider's hosted search when
  the connection allows it and the protocol has one (Anthropic, OpenAI Responses, Gemini
  grounding); otherwise Kintsugi's own `web_search`/`web_fetch` when a `WebSearchBackend` is set
  (Ollama web, Tavily, Brave, SearXNG); otherwise a prompt telling the model to flag in the script
  that it had no web access. Hosted and Kintsugi tools are never offered together — Gemini refuses
  the mixture — and with no backend no tools at all are sent, because a local model without tool
  support errors on a request that carries any. `OLLAMA_WEB_API_KEY` is still honoured as the
  backend when none is configured.
- **`web_fetch` is an SSRF surface, and `SafeWebFetcher` is the whole defence.** The URL comes from
  a model whose input includes pages it has read, so a page can ask for
  `http://169.254.169.254/…` — on GKE, the pod's Google credentials. The address is checked in the
  socket's `ConnectCallback`, against the address actually dialled, so DNS rebinding cannot swap it
  after a check; redirects are followed by hand through the same callback. Loopback, RFC 1918, ULA,
  link-local, CGNAT, multicast and documentation ranges are refused in IPv4, IPv6 and IPv4-mapped
  form. Do not give it a shared `HttpClient`.
- **Google Cloud authentication stores nothing.** `AiAuthMode.GoogleCloud` takes a token from the
  metadata server (`GoogleCloudAccessTokenProvider`) — the pod's own service account under
  Workload Identity — for Gemini and Claude on Vertex (`…/publishers/{google|anthropic}/models/…`)
  and Vertex's OpenAI-compatible endpoint. The location is where inference runs, which is a
  data-residency decision.

Assistant turns are replayed verbatim (`AiChatMessage.ProviderContent`) rather than rebuilt:
Anthropic insists on its own `tool_use` blocks back, and Gemini rejects a function call returned
without its `thoughtSignature`. The protocol is derived per *model* from models.dev's `npm` field,
because `google-vertex` lists Claude models whose own package is `@ai-sdk/google-vertex/anthropic`.
Bedrock has no adapter and is dropped from the catalog. `AiProviderSettingsResolver` is the one
place that decides whether AI is configured — Routed mode counts only with a script-research route
— so the upgrade-path scan and the vulnerability run cannot disagree. The new enums cross the wire
as ordinals like `AiProvider`; `web/test/data/ai_routing_mapper_test.dart` pins their positions.


## Remote control: the server's half

The agents' half is in `clients/CLAUDE.md`; the viewer's is in `web/CLAUDE.md`.

**Two auth mechanisms, one on each end, and that is why this is a relay rather than a direct
connection.** The agent's sockets arrive on `/api/remote-control`, inside nginx's exact-match
client-certificate regex, carrying `[RequireAgentIdentity]` so the verified CN must equal the serial
number in the query string. The browser's arrives on `/api/admin/remote-control/...`, outside that
regex and carrying `[RequireAdminSession]`. Neither end could be authenticated by the other's
mechanism, and mutual TLS can only be verified by whatever terminates it — which is nginx. A
peer-to-peer or TURN-relayed design re-terminates somewhere holding no fleet CA, so it would need a
second, parallel auth mechanism *and* an inbound port on every managed Mac. Same constraint as
"The fallback is a guess" in web/CLAUDE.md.


**The server relays the media protocol without parsing it, and that is load-bearing.** Once the two
sockets are joined, `RemoteControlSessionBroker` copies bytes between them with message type and
boundaries preserved and nothing in between reading either direction. So the JPEG tiling, the
pointer coordinate space and the keycode mapping are a contract between
`clients/macos-agent/src/remote_protocol.rs` and `web/lib/data/models/remote_control_mapper.dart`
**alone** — adding a capability to the viewer needs no server change, and nothing in the server will
ever catch the two ends drifting apart. `web/test/data/remote_control_mapper_test.dart` asserts the
exact bytes the agent's own `encodes_a_tile_header_big_endian` test produces, which is the only
thing that does.


**One route for the agent's two sockets, because nginx's regex matches a single path segment.** The
standing *control* socket (`?serialNumber=`) and a per-session *media* socket
(`?serialNumber=&sessionId=`) share `/api/remote-control` and are told apart by query string. That
also means `[RequireAgentIdentity]` works unchanged — it falls back to an action argument named
`serialNumber`, and a WebSocket handshake has no body for it to read. The route has its own `=`
location in `default.conf` rather than another alternative in the regex, because a WebSocket needs a
read timeout measured in hours and putting that on the agent block would apply it to `/api/host`
too, where a request holding a worker for an hour is the worse failure.


**The relay is in-memory and single-process.** A session pairs two sockets that must land in the
same process, so a second API replica behind a load balancer would break remote control specifically
unless both were routed to the same instance. Nothing does that today — compose runs one `api` — but
it is the assumption to check first if that changes.


## Compliance evidence: the Vanta integration

Kintsugi pushes its view of the fleet into Vanta as a private "Build integrations" data source
(https://developer.vanta.com/reference/build-integrations.json). Configured at Settings > Vanta,
run on a timer by `VantaSyncBackgroundService`, and **off until an administrator turns it on** —
`VantaSettings` is deliberately *not* seeded from the environment the way `GitHubSettings` is, since
that seeding exists only to carry deployments off variables that used to be there, and these never
were.

**Two of the spec's thirteen resource types are synced, and the eleven omissions include two that
look like the obvious fit.** A host becomes a `VulnerableComponent`; each out-of-date application on
it, and each pending OS update, becomes a `PackageVulnerabilityConnectors` record naming that
component. What is *not* synced is `macos_user_computer` and `windows_user_computer`, and the reason
is not effort: every one of `drives`, `users`, `systemScreenlockPolicies`, `isManaged` and
`autoUpdatesEnabled` is **required** by those schemas, and Kintsugi collects none of them. An empty
`drives` array is not a gap in a compliance tool, it is an assertion about disk encryption — so
filling those from defaults would put invented evidence behind real controls. (There is no
`linux_user_computer` endpoint at all, so a third of the fleet could not be covered even if the data
existed.) The Vanta screen says all of this out loud; keep it saying it.

**`severity` is a number the administrator picks, and the CVSS fields are absent rather than
nullable.** Vanta makes severity mandatory on a 0-10 scale. Kintsugi compares an installed version
against a latest known version; it has no CVE feed, no CVSS vector and no reachability analysis. So
`VantaSettings.Severity` is one configured constant applied uniformly, `VantaPackageVulnerability`
has no `CveId`/`Cvss3Score`/`Cvss3Vector`/`IsReachable` properties **at all** (a test asserts that),
and each record's own description says it came from a version comparison rather than a feed. Do not
"improve" this by deriving a score from staleness — a plausible number in a compliance record is
worse than an honest constant.

**Every sync is a state-of-the-world replacement, which makes an empty payload a deletion.** Vanta
deletes any `uniqueId` previously sent and now omitted, so there is no chunked or incremental form of
this: `VantaResourceBuilder.Build` produces the complete set in memory and only then does
`SyncVantaResourcesCommandHandler` send it. That handler carries the one guard that matters — **zero
components is never sent**, because a query returning no hosts would otherwise wipe the whole
inventory, and a fleet with no hosts has nothing to sync anyway. The asymmetry is deliberate and must
not be "fixed": an empty *package* list **is** sent, and is how a fleet that has just finished
patching clears what Vanta still holds for it.

**Order matters, and a failed component sync cancels the package sync.** Each package names its
component by `uniqueId`, so components land first; if that call fails, packages are not sent at all
rather than sent as orphans.

**`uniqueId`s are derived, never row identity.** A host keys on its serial number — the value that
*is* this system's host identity (it is the certificate CN) and the only one that survives both a
`Reregister` hostname change and a delete-and-re-enroll, which mints a fresh `Host.Id`. An
application keys on (serial, application name) and explicitly **not** on `InstalledApplication.Id`,
because `RegisterApplicationsCommandHandler` deletes and recreates every row on each routine
inventory report: a row-keyed id would change on every check-in, and since each sync replaces
everything, Vanta would see the fleet's entire vulnerability history deleted and recreated daily.

**`collectedTimestamp` is `Host.LastSeenUtc`, not now**, and a host that has never checked in is
dropped from the sync entirely rather than stamped with the current time — nothing has been collected
from it. Its applications go with it, since a package naming an absent component is an orphan.

**One access token, and that shapes the concurrency.** Vanta issues one active token per application
and *revokes the previous one the moment a new one is requested*, so `VantaAccessTokenProvider` is a
singleton holding a single cached token behind a `SemaphoreSlim`, keyed on the credentials it was
obtained with (rotating the secret on the settings page therefore invalidates it implicitly).
`VantaSyncCoordinator` allows one run at a time for the same reason, and "Sync now" answers `409`
rather than queueing. The token is attached to each individual request, never to
`HttpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders` — the same rule the GitHub clients follow, and for the same
reason: a typed client outlives one call.

**`VantaSettings.ConsoleBaseUrl` is its own setting and is not `AGENT_API_BASE_URL`.** It is the
address every synced record links back to, so it must be the *browser's* door, not nginx's agent one
— see "The fallback is a guess" in web/CLAUDE.md. It cannot be derived from the request either,
because the sync normally runs on a timer with nothing in flight. HTTPS is enforced at save time in
the domain entity, because Vanta requires it and the alternative is an opaque rejection a day later.


## Vulnerability assessment: NVD and the KEV catalogue

Settings > Vulnerabilities matches the fleet's installed versions against published CVEs, and the
Vulnerabilities screen shows the result. It is the first thing here that reads a real vulnerability
feed; everything the Vanta section above says about *not* having one remains true of that
integration, which this deliberately does not feed.

**NVD evaluates the version ranges, and that is the load-bearing fact of the whole feature.**
Handing `virtualMatchString` a CPE name carrying a concrete version returns only the CVEs whose
configurations actually cover it — verified against the live API: Firefox answers 3337 CVEs at
`*`, 1508 at 60.0, 631 at 130.0 and 414 at 145.0. So nothing here parses `versionStartIncluding` or
`versionEndExcluding`, and nothing should start. Re-implementing that matching locally would be a
second, divergent opinion about which versions a CVE affects, against a source that already has
one.

**What is left is name → CPE, and it is a human decision.** NVD's own dictionary keyword-search
ranks Slackware Linux first for "slack" and ZoomText first for "zoom", and the inventory carries a
display name, not a vendor. So a `CpeMapping` is proposed by machine and **confirmed by a person**,
and nothing is assessed until it has been. Two things make that safe rather than ceremonial:
`INvdClient.CpeExistsAsync` discards a proposal NVD's dictionary does not contain (`a:mozilla:firefox`
answers 1199, the invented `a:mozilla:firefax` answers 0, and so does the plausible `a:slack:slack`),
and the check runs **again on confirm**, because a reviewer can type a correction by hand and a typo
attributes another product's CVEs to this one.

**The AI is asked for a search term, never for a fact.** `ICpeSuggestionClient` — implemented on
`AiUpgradePathResearchClient` so it reuses that type's per-provider dispatch rather than growing a
second copy — asks only for the vendor and product tokens NVD indexes a product under. It is not
asked whether anything is vulnerable, which CVEs apply, or how serious they are. That is the same
line `VantaResourceBuilder` draws at severity, and the difference that makes this side of it
acceptable is that "does `a:mozilla:firefox` name a real product" has an external authority to check
against and "how dangerous is being out of date" does not.

**Bulk confirmation deliberately does not re-ask the dictionary, and that is the only reason it is
usable.** `ConfirmCpeMappingsCommand` accepts what each selected row already carries and makes no
NVD call at all: a stored suggestion was checked before it was written, so re-asking would spend one
request per ticked row against an allowance of five per thirty seconds to re-learn what this system
established when it wrote the row. The single-row `ConfirmCpeMappingCommand` still asks, because
there the pair may be something a reviewer has just typed — that is the check the bulk path is
*not* skipping, and the distinction to keep if either route changes. It also carries each
suggestion's own `CpeSuggestionSource` through rather than stamping it `Manual`: nobody typed
anything, and the Confidence column reads that field. Rows with nothing proposed, rows already
confirmed and ids that no longer exist come back in `BulkCpeMappingResultDto.Skipped`, by name — a
bulk action that reports a number and not the rows behind it reads as a success.

**`CpeConfidence` scores a proposal, and is computed on every read.** A function of the display
name, the vendor and product and how they were arrived at — all already on the row — so persisting
it would only create a second copy to fall out of step. The model is never asked how sure it is: a
self-reported score has no external authority behind it, which is the same line
`VantaResourceBuilder` draws at severity. What it compares is *whole words*, never substrings,
because "slack" sits inside `slackware_linux` and "zoom" inside `zoomtext` — a containment test
marks the two mappings this whole feature exists to prevent as near misses worth accepting.

**Nothing is keyed on `InstalledApplication.Id`, and that is not incidental.**
`RegisterApplicationsCommandHandler` deletes and recreates every installed-application row on each
routine inventory report, so a mapping keyed on one would evaporate hourly and take a human's
confirmation with it. `CpeMapping` keys on the *reported name*, `CpeAssessment` keys on (mapping,
version), and which hosts are affected is a join computed at query time. It is the same reasoning
that makes a Vanta `uniqueId` a (serial, application name) pair.

**A run is bounded and resumable, and a partial run is the normal case.** A full pass is one NVD
query per (confirmed mapping, distinct installed version) — hundreds on a real fleet — against a
limit of 5 requests per rolling 30 seconds anonymously and 50 with a free API key. So
`RunVulnerabilityAssessmentCommandHandler` takes the least recently assessed pairs first, commits
each as it completes, and stops at `VulnerabilitySettings.AssessmentsPerRun`; `CpeAssessment.LastAssessedUtc`
is the cursor, and is stamped **even on failure** so a pair NVD keeps rejecting cannot park itself at
the head of the queue and starve everything behind it. The four stages (KEV refresh, discovery,
suggestion, assessment) each commit before the next and a failing stage does not abort the run —
they fail for unrelated reasons, and an unconfigured AI provider must not stop a KEV refresh that
needs no AI.

**`NvdRateLimiter` is a singleton because the limit belongs to the server.** NVD counts per source
address over a rolling window, so two components each keeping their own tally would each stay under
the limit and together sail past it — and NVD answers that with a **403**, which reads like an
authentication failure. It follows that a reviewer's dictionary search shares one allowance with a
running assessment; that is why `/api/admin/vulnerabilities/cpe-dictionary` has its own nginx
`location` with a 180s read timeout, since the general `/api` block's 60s would turn a correct
31-second wait into a 504.

**A KEV entry cannot tell you whether you are affected.** CISA's catalogue is a CVE id, a vendor, a
product and a due date, with **no version ranges at all**. So `KnownExploited` is only ever an
overlay on a match NVD's ranges already produced; scanning the inventory for KEV's product names
instead would flag every host running any version of a named product, patched or not. The two
sources also write to disjoint halves of `Vulnerability` — `ApplyKevEntry` and `ApplyNvdRecord`
never touch each other's fields — because a CVE can reach the table from either one first. A failed
KEV fetch withdraws nothing: "the download failed" and "CISA no longer lists this" are different
facts and only the second may clear a flag.

**Coverage this feature does not have is a first-class number, not an omission.** An application
with no confirmed CPE has not been assessed at all, and a screen listing only what it matched would
read as a clean bill of health — the failure the eleven unsynced Vanta resource types exist to
avoid. So `VulnerabilitySummaryDto` carries `UnmappedSubjectCount` and `UnassessableHostCount`
beside the findings, and an empty findings table distinguishes "nothing found" from "nothing looked
at".

**Operating systems go through the same queue, and coverage differs sharply by platform.**
`OperatingSystemSubject` resolves an identity and a version and deliberately *not* a vendor or
product — a table of `macOS → apple:macos` guesses here would be the same unchecked second opinion
the mapping queue exists to prevent. macOS needs nothing from its agent. Windows needs the build's
update revision, and **refuses to assess without it** rather than assuming `.0`: NVD matches on the
revision, so `10.0.22631.4317` answers 1355 CVEs where `10.0.22631.6000` answers 793 and `.0` would
report nearly all of them against a patched machine. Linux needs os-release's `ID` and `VERSION_ID`,
because `PRETTY_NAME` is prose. One limit no agent release fixes: NVD's coverage of a Linux
distribution *as an operating system* is thin — `canonical:ubuntu_linux:24.04` answers 25 CVEs
against macOS 14.5's 1138 — because the real Linux surface is per source package and lives in the
distributions' own trackers. Those are now reachable — the Linux agent reports its dpkg/rpm
inventory and the package stage below asks OSV about it — so the *release-level* answer here
remains thin while the useful one comes from packages.


**A run reports what it is doing, and a run can be stopped — neither of which the Vanta
coordinator this one was modelled on needs.** A sync there is one call over in seconds; a run here
is minutes to hours, bounded by NVD's rate limit rather than by how fast this server works. So
`IVulnerabilityRunProgress` carries a stage, the one subject being checked, and a count, and
`IVulnerabilityRunCoordinator.TryCancel` fires a per-run `CancellationTokenSource` that
`VulnerabilityAssessmentBackgroundService` links with the host's stopping token.

Three decisions there are load-bearing.

**Progress is per stage, never one total across the run.** The five stages cost wildly different
amounts, so a single bar would sit between 4% and 6% for most of a run and then leap; each stage
names itself and counts its own items, and a stage with nothing countable — the KEV download, the
discovery pass — reports a total of zero, which the screen draws as an indeterminate bar rather
than as "0 of 0". The package stage is named honestly at each granularity: the *batch* by ecosystem
and size while OSV is being asked (it answers two hundred at once, so no one package is "being
checked"), the *advisory id* during the per-record fetches that are the slow part, and the
*package* while each answer is folded in. The stage labels are prose constants rather than an enum,
because nothing branches on them and an enum would cross the wire as an ordinal.

**A cancel must be told from a shutdown, or cancelling ends every future run.**
`VulnerabilityAssessmentBackgroundService`'s `OperationCanceledException` branch used to assume the
host was stopping and `break` out of its loop. With cancel wired in, that would silently stop the
service scheduling anything again until the process restarted — under a status line blaming a
shutdown that never happened. It now branches on `stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested`.

**A cancelled run is its own outcome, not a failure.** Every stage commits as it goes, so stopping
one keeps everything already assessed and the queue resumes from there — reporting that in red as
"the last assessment did not complete" would say the opposite of what happened, the same flattening
`_CoverageNotice` refuses by being an info box. So `Cancelled()` sits beside `Complete` and `Fault`,
leaves `LastRunSucceeded` **null** (it neither succeeded nor failed), sets `LastRunCancelled`, and
composes its message out of the progress the coordinator was already holding — "Stopped while
checking Linux packages, after 412 of 4000." The client reads `lastRunCancelled` *first*, because
null `lastRunSucceeded` is also what "nothing has run since this server started" looks like.

### Linux packages: a second source, because NVD cannot answer this question

**Distribution packages are assessed against OSV, never against NVD's CPE ranges, and that is a
correctness requirement rather than a preference.** Distributions backport security fixes without
changing the upstream version, so a CPE match on a dpkg version reports CVEs that were fixed
months ago. Verified against the live API and then end to end through this code: Ubuntu 22.04's
`openssl` answers 49 matches at `3.0.2-0ubuntu1.15` and 41 at `3.0.2-0ubuntu1.19` — the same
upstream 3.0.2 either way. `PackageAssessment` exists separately from `CpeAssessment` for this
reason; do not unify them.

**The package name is the *source* package.** `libssl3` answers 0 vulnerabilities on Ubuntu 22.04
where its source `openssl` answers 48, and `libc6` answers 0 where `glibc` answers 38 — OSV and
the distributions both key on source packages. The agent reads `${source:Package}` from dpkg and
parses rpm's from `%{SOURCERPM}`. Reporting binary names would under-report nearly everything
while looking like it worked.

**A package needs no mapping queue, unlike an application.** A CPE has to be confirmed by a human
because "slack" could be Slackware; a distribution's own source-package name is unambiguous, so
packages produce findings the moment they are reported. That also means a Linux-only fleet has
real coverage with zero confirmed `CpeMapping`s — which is why `VulnerabilitySummaryDto` carries
`AssessedPackageCount` and the screen's "nothing looked at yet" test reads both.

**Query by name and ecosystem, never by purl, and batch per ecosystem.** `pkg:rpm/rocky/...`
answers nothing where `{name, ecosystem: "Rocky Linux:9"}` answers ten. And OSV validates the
ecosystem — an unrecognized one fails with **400 "invalid ecosystem"**, not with an empty result,
which is the good failure: it is how a distribution OSV does not cover (Fedora) surfaces as a
stated gap rather than as a clean host. Since that 400 fails the *whole* batch, batches are built
per ecosystem so one unsupported distribution cannot take every other host's answer with it.

**Most OSV identifiers name their own CVE; the ones that do not are cached forever.**
`UBUNTU-CVE-2024-2511` needs no lookup (`OsvAdvisory.CveFromIdentifier`), but `USN-7980-1` stands
for twelve CVEs and `RLSA-2022:7288` for two, and only their records say so. `osv_advisories`
caches the answer including "no CVE at all", which is a real case for a distribution-only
advisory and would otherwise be re-fetched every run. The CVE id is read from OSV's `upstream`
field — `aliases` is read too, but every record checked carried them in `upstream`.

**A CVE found only through a package would otherwise have no score, so one is computed.** OSV
answers "this version is affected" and carries the advisory's CVSS *vector*; the base *score* is
something NVD publishes. Left alone, the majority of a Linux fleet's findings would sit on the
screen as "Unscored" — unsortable, unbandable — with everything needed to score them already
downloaded. `CvssVector.Score` computes it.

That is arithmetic, not estimation, and the distinction is the whole justification: a CVSS base
score is a pure function of its vector, specified exactly by FIRST, so the number computed here
for a vector is the number NVD publishes for that same vector. Verified end to end —
CVE-2023-4911 derived as 7.8 HIGH v3.1 from Ubuntu's advisory, against NVD's published 7.8 HIGH
v3.1, from an identical vector. Compare `VantaResourceBuilder`, which refuses to derive a
severity: staleness has no such formula behind it, and that is exactly why one is refused there
and computed here.

Three rules hold it together. **NVD always wins** — `ApplyDerivedScore` returns early if a score
is already held, and `ApplyNvdRecord` overwrites unconditionally *but only when NVD actually has a
score*, so a re-run of an unanalysed CVE cannot blank a derived one. **The vector is always
stored**, so the number is checkable against its input. And **`CvssDerivedFromVector` is on the
wire and on the screen**, because the vector may be the distribution's analysis rather than NVD's
and two analysts can reach different vectors for one CVE. Only v3.0 and v3.1 are computed; v4.0
needs a MacroVector table and v2 is a different formula, and for either the score stays null
rather than being guessed.

The fetch that supplies the vector is **demand-driven**: an identifier that names its own CVE and
whose CVE already has a score costs nothing, and every fetch is cached in `osv_advisories`
permanently, so the expense shrinks each run. `OsvFetchesPerRun` bounds it because these are
sequential where the batch query is not.

**A CVE row is upserted once per OSV batch, because the save is once per batch.** This stage
commits per batch where the NVD stage commits per pair, and `UpsertCveRowsAsync` finds an existing
CVE with a *query* — which cannot see rows the current transaction has added and not yet saved. So
upserting per package meant two packages in one batch sharing a CVE nobody had seen before each
created a `Vulnerability` for it, and the second broke the unique index on `CveId`, taking the whole
batch's save down. Not an edge case: the same source package at two installed versions is two
triples in one ecosystem's batch sharing nearly all of its CVEs, and on a first run every CVE is
new — it failed every batch of a real run. Keep the upsert at batch scope; the per-package loop
below it only projects each package's own slice of what the batch already created.

**A failed batch is detached, and that is the counterpart to keeping subjects tracked.**
`DetachAssessedVulnerabilities` deliberately leaves assessments tracked so `RecordAssessment` on the
next iteration is not mutating a detached object — right for the loop, wrong for a batch whose save
has just failed, whose mutations would then be committed by the *next* batch's successful save.
That would write a `MatchCount` for match rows `ReplacePackageMatchesAsync` had already deleted
(`ExecuteDelete` commits on its own, outside the unit of work) and never re-inserted: a count with
no findings behind it, which is the clean bill of health this whole feature exists to refuse. Hence
`DetachPackageAssessments`, and hence a failed batch staying due for the next run.

**A save failure is reported with its inner exception.** `DbUpdateException.Message` is the same
fixed sentence for every cause and every table — "An error occurred while saving the entity changes.
See the inner exception for details." — and these strings are the only account of a failed run
anybody gets, on the Vulnerabilities settings screen. `InnermostMessage` unwraps it, which is what
turned the duplicate-CVE failure above from three identical unactionable sentences into a named
constraint. Every stage's problem goes through it, not only the two saves that prompted it — each
stage wraps a `SaveChangesAsync` of its own, and a failed HTTP call keeps the connection error in
its inner exception too. A new `problems.Add` belongs there as well.

**The package list rides in `POST /api/applications` and must never sink it.**
`RegisterApplicationsCommandValidator.MaxPackages` (10000) sits deliberately above each agent's
`MAX_REPORTED_PACKAGES` (5000) — the same asymmetry `MaxDetailsLength` keeps against
`MAX_REPORTED_FAILURE_BYTES`, and for a sharper reason: the packages travel in the same request
as the application inventory, so a report rejected for being one package over would take that
host's applications down with it and leave the Applications screen quietly wrong. Raise the
server's figure before raising the agents', never after.


## Audit event shipping: the Auditing settings

Settings > Auditing names the logging platform a record of what happens here is shipped to —
Datadog, Grafana Loki, Google Cloud Logging, AWS CloudWatch Logs, Azure Monitor, Splunk HEC, or any
endpoint that takes JSON over HTTP. It is modelled on the Authentication screen: one provider chosen
from a list, the fields that provider needs, and setup instructions for exactly that provider beside
them.

**Nothing ships events yet, and that is the current state rather than an oversight.** `AuditSettings`
is written and read and nothing consumes it; the configuration was built first so the credential and
the destination exist before there is anything to send. What the screen's instructions promise is
therefore a specification for whatever implements the sending — the URL paths, header names and
label values named there (`/api/v2/logs` with `DD-API-KEY`, `/loki/api/v1/push` under a single
`app="kintsugi"` label, `Authorization: Splunk <token>` with sourcetype `_json`, …) are what an
operator granting a credential from those steps is entitled to have arrive. Change one and change
the instructions with it.

**Changing the provider drops the stored secret, unlike every other settings screen.** A blank secret
on the way in means "keep the stored one" — the page never received the real value, so it cannot send
it back unchanged — but that only holds for the *same* provider. A Datadog API key is not an AWS
secret access key, and carrying one across would ship a credential issued by one vendor to another on
the first event. `AuditSettings.Apply` is where that happens, and the screen says so beside the field.

**Three places state which fields a provider needs, and they must agree.** `AuditSettings.Apply`
keeps the invariant true whoever writes to it; `UpdateAuditSettingsCommandValidator` duplicates it
deliberately, so a bad save lands under the field that caused it rather than as one sentence at the
top; and `auditing_screen.dart` decides which boxes to show and restates the requirements as
instructions. The validator's messages are keyed by C# property name, which is how a field error
finds its box — so `Region` is the Datadog site *and* the AWS region, and `ClientId` is the AWS access
key ID, the Azure application ID and the Grafana Cloud username. Those columns are shared on purpose;
renaming one to suit a single provider breaks the other two.

**`AuditProvider` crosses the wire as an ordinal**, like `AuthProvider` and for the same reason, so
declaration order in `web/lib/domain/entities/enums.dart` mirrors the C# enum and new members are
appended, never inserted. The secret is never returned by any route — `AuditSettingsDto` carries
`HasSecret` instead, which is what lets the form honestly offer "leave blank to keep the existing
one".



## Platform buckets, and why package managers get their own

`PlatformBucket` keys an `upgrade_paths` row. An AI-researched row lives under an *OS* bucket
(`macOS`, `Windows`, `Linux`); a package-manager-managed row lives under its *manager's* bucket
(`pm:Homebrew`, `pm:App Store`, `pm:winget`, `pm:Chocolatey`, `pm:Flatpak`, `pm:Snap` — see
`PlatformBucket.ForPackageManager`), because what a `brew upgrade` row actually depends on is the
manager, not the OS.

That used to be one shared `generic` bucket, which was safe only while Homebrew was the sole package
manager: `UpgradePathRepository`'s lookup falls back to it for *any* host, so a Windows host with an
application whose name matched a Homebrew formula would have been handed a signed `#!/bin/bash`
script — and, the signature being genuine, its agent would have run it. The fallback is now to the
bucket of whichever manager owns that installation, resolved from the installed application's
parent. `SplitPackageManagerPlatformBucket` migrates the pre-existing `generic` rows in place rather
than deleting them, specifically to preserve their `ScriptSignature` (a human's review).

Adding a package manager means one entry in `PackageManagerCatalog` plus a `*UpgradeScript` builder.
The catalog is what both `ResearchApplicationUpgradePathCommandHandler` and
`RegisterApplicationsCommandHandler` recognize managers by, so they can't drift apart.

**There is a hard entry requirement for that catalog, and it is not "an agent can drive it".** A
manager belongs there only if its catalog can be queried *over HTTP from the API server*, because
that is where `--update-version` runs and because one row per (application, manager) is shared by the
whole fleet. Homebrew, winget, Chocolatey, Flathub, the Snap Store and the Mac App Store (via Apple's
iTunes Search API) each publish one global
catalog and satisfy both. **apt, dnf, zypper and pacman satisfy neither** — "the latest version of
curl" depends on which repositories *that* host has configured, and one `pm:APT` row would have
Debian 12 and Ubuntu 24.04 overwriting each other's answer forever. So they are deliberately absent,
and the Linux agent reports what they manage as *OS updates* instead: `apt`/`dnf` is to Linux what
`softwareupdate` is to macOS — it patches the operating system and everything the vendor ships with
it. That is why the Linux inventory lists only Flatpak and Snap **applications**, and it is not a
gap. See its `os_update` and `main::collect_installed_applications`.

**That reasoning is about patchability, and it survives the package inventory added later.** The
Linux agent does now report every dpkg/rpm package — but as `InstalledPackage`, into its own
table, purely so the vulnerability assessment can ask a distribution's advisories about it. No
`upgrade_paths` row is created, nothing is offered to the AI, nothing is patchable, and nothing
appears on the Applications screen. apt and dnf are still absent from `PackageManagerCatalog` for
exactly the reason above, and reporting an inventory asks nothing of that catalogue. Do not read
the package table as an invitation to add them.

Every `*UpgradeScript.Build` must return **byte-identical content for every application** — the
name and id are read from `--appName`/`--appId` at runtime, never baked in. That is what lets one
human "Sign Script" review cover every application a manager handles, via
`FindExistingSignatureForScriptAsync`.

**An App Store bundle is told apart by its receipt, and reporting it as a plain bundle was actively
harmful.** `Contents/_MASReceipt/receipt` exists in every bundle the Mac App Store installed and in
nothing else — `/System/Applications/*` never carries one. The macOS agent's `read_app_bundle` reports
such a bundle under the `App Store` manager (`system_info::APP_STORE_NAME`, the same string as
`PackageManagerCatalog.AppStore`) with its bundle identifier, and reports the store itself once as
their manager. Before that, an App Store app was a standalone application and went to the AI, whose
macOS prompt assumes a Developer-ID distribution and writes a script that fetches the vendor's DMG
and replaces the bundle — swapping a store build for a direct-download one, receipt and sandbox
container gone, with the store no longer updating it. Signed and approved, that ran as root through
the queue and nothing errored. The receipt also decides what `com.apple.` means: Xcode, Pages,
Keynote, Numbers, iMovie and GarageBand are Apple's *and* sold through the store, and skipping them by
prefix left a Mac with four of them out of date reporting nothing. A VPP-licensed bundle
(`kMDItemAppStoreReceiptIsVPPLicensed`, an MDM's device-based assignment) is reported without an
identifier, because the MDM owns it and no Apple Account can update it.

Two things about `AppStoreUpgradeScript`'s version check fail silently if changed. Its lookup is
`itunes.apple.com/lookup?bundleId=…&entity=desktopSoftware` — **not `macSoftware`**, which for an app
sold as one purchase on iOS and macOS returns the iOS record (Pages 15.3 against a Mac build of
15.3.1; `mas` queries `desktopSoftware` for the same reason). Without `country=` it asks the US
storefront, so an app not sold there answers `resultCount: 0` and the row's `LatestVersion` stays null
— the server cannot know a host's storefront, so this is documented rather than solved.

**An App Store update runs as root, from the daemon, inside the console user's session — the mirror
image of Homebrew.** Since Apple's fix for CVE-2025-43411 (macOS 14.8.2 / 15.7.2 / 26.1) installing a
store update needs root, while starting the download needs the logged-in user's store session:
CommerceKit talks to `com.apple.appstoreagent` in that user's `gui/<uid>` launchd domain, which a bare
root process cannot see (`No bag entry`). The per-user process is one of those two and cannot become
the other — `mas ≥ 4` bridges them by running `sudo installer` itself, and a LaunchAgent has no TTY to
answer it. Root can be both: `launchctl asuser <uid>` puts it inside the user's bootstrap namespace
while it stays uid 0, `mas` — handed `SUDO_UID`/`SUDO_GID` by hand — seteuid's to the user for the
CommerceKit half, and its `sudo installer` asks no password because the real uid is already 0. This
was verified from a real LaunchDaemon on macOS 26.6 (Numbers 15.1 → 15.3.1), *not* from `sudo` in a
Terminal — `sudo` keeps the caller's audit session, and so does `sudo launchctl submit`, which lands
the job in `gui/<uid>` and proves nothing about the daemon; only a plist bootstrapped into the
`system` domain does. So `upgrade::runs_as_root` sends this manager's rows to the root queue by name
(`system_info::APP_STORE_NAME`), the script refuses on its first line if it is not root, and the
`launchctl asuser` dance lives in the script rather than the agent, the way AI-written scripts already
`launchctl asuser … osascript` to quit an application.

**The `mas` it runs is the agent's own root-owned copy, `/usr/local/bin/kintsugi-mas`, and that is not
packaging tidiness.** A root daemon executing Homebrew's `/opt/homebrew/bin/mas` — user-writable — is
root for whoever owns the Homebrew prefix. `publish-release.sh` fetches mas-cli's two per-architecture
`.pkg`s pinned by digest, extracts the Mach-O (`libexec/bin/mas`; `bin/mas` is a zsh formatting
wrapper), `lipo`s them into one universal file, signs it with the fleet identity like the agent, and
refuses to build a single-architecture one; `install.sh` installs it `root:wheel 0755`, `self_update`
replaces it from the same archive whenever one is present (so a host installed before it gains App
Store patching on its next update), and the script checks owner *and* mode before executing it — on
an Intel Mac `/usr/local/bin` is Homebrew's user-owned prefix, so a swapped file there would be
owned by whoever swapped it, which is exactly what the check catches. Bumping `MAS_VERSION` means
re-pinning both digests and re-running the LaunchDaemon check above: mas drives private frameworks
and has broken on macOS majors before; mas 7 needs macOS 13. Two behaviours of `mas` are
load-bearing in the script: it resolves installed apps through Spotlight and re-indexes any it
finds unindexed (noisy, harmless), and a `mas update` with nothing to do **exits 0 having printed
nothing** — so the script treats empty output as failure, because exit 0 is what makes
`patch_cycle::run_patches` report the server's latest version as installed, and a silent no-op would
be a patch result the next inventory contradicts. A store dialog is still possible (an app owned by
a different Apple Account); that is the honest outcome, and nothing here can answer it.

**A signed script is never rewritten by a deployment, and editing one of those bodies changes
nothing until a human says so.** `RegisterApplicationsCommandHandler` used to rewrite `Script` from
the builder on every routine inventory report, under the belief that "the script content for a given
(manager, isSelfUpdate) case never changes". It changes whenever one of those bodies is edited — so
what that actually meant was that a background report could swap the content of a signed row,
content the fleet's agents may be executing right now, on the strength of a deployment nobody was
watching. It is exactly what `UpgradePath.AdoptApprovedScript` refuses to do, and a report has less
business doing it than a human pressing Adopt. Now a row that carries a `ScriptSignature` keeps its
script exactly as reviewed and only `LatestVersion` moves.

**What an unsigned or new row gets is the bucket's reviewed script, not the builder's — and that
rule is `PackageManagerBucketScript`, used by both writers.** Protecting signed rows alone shipped a
second bug: after a builder edit the reviewed rows kept the old text while every row seeded *after*
the deployment — a host installing a new formula, a "Find Upgrade Paths" for one, a force-recheck —
got the new text from the builder, unsigned, because no signature existed for those bytes. The
Upgrade Scripts screen showed two `Homebrew (any managed application)` entries (118 applications and
4), and the 4 were quietly not patching. So `RegisterApplicationsCommandHandler` and
`ResearchApplicationUpgradePathCommandHandler.ApplyPackageManagerCommandAsync` both ask
`IUpgradePathRepository.GetSignedPackageManagerScriptAsync` what the bucket already runs and write
that, signature included; the builder is consulted only for a bucket in which nothing has been
reviewed yet — the very first script per manager, which a human still signs. A package-manager
bucket therefore holds one script, the builder's newer text reaches it only through
`TakeServerWrittenScriptCommand` (which moves every row at once), and a stray unsigned row on a
different text is pulled back into line by the next report. Do not reintroduce a
`packageManager.BuildScript()` call on a write path outside that helper. Signed rows are still never
touched: two *signed* texts in one bucket can only come from a human pasting and then signing a
different script on one row, and that is shown as two entries rather than undone; new rows join the
text on the most rows.

Two things follow. `UpgradePath.Apply` drops `ScriptSignature` whenever the content it is replacing
actually differs (same for `Command`/`CommandSignature`) — the invariant that a signature never
outlives its bytes, which now only ever fires on a deliberate act (a force-refresh, a pasted script,
`TakeServerWrittenScript`) rather than in the background. And because nothing takes the newer script
by itself, the Upgrade Scripts screen has to say one exists: `PackageManagerCatalog.CurrentScriptFor`
gives the query handler the script this build would write, `LocalScriptDto.NewerServerScriptAvailable`
flags a script that differs, and `TakeServerWrittenScriptCommand` replaces it — **unsigned**, so the
new text reaches no host until someone has read it, and one "Sign Script" then covers every row
holding those bytes via `FindExistingSignatureForScriptAsync`. Do not make that automatic on the
grounds that the server trusts its own generated content: the review is the only thing standing
between an edited builder body and root execution on every host.

**The Upgrade Scripts screen lists scripts, not rows.** A package-manager bucket holds one row per
application and the same bytes on every one of them, so listing rows put "firefox", "slack", "zoom"…
under `pm:Homebrew` as hundreds of copies of one decision with nothing per-application on any of
them for a reviewer to look at. `GetUpgradeScriptsOverviewQueryHandler` therefore collapses the rows
of a *recognized* manager's bucket into one `LocalScriptDto` per (bucket, content, signed-or-not),
named the way the approval repository names the same bytes
(`ApprovedScriptIdentity.PackageManagerDisplayName`), with `Applications` saying how many rows it
stands for; an AI-researched row is one application's script and stays its own entry. Content is
part of the key because a bucket legitimately holds two texts at once — rows signed against an older
builder revision beside rows this build wrote — and the review is per text. That is also why
`TakeServerWrittenScriptCommand` is addressed by `(Platform, Sha256)` rather than by row: the button
sits on the entry, and taking the newer text for one application while its siblings kept the old
would leave a bucket running two revisions with nothing to say which was reviewed. A hash that no
longer matches anything is a stale page and answers NotFound rather than acting on whatever
replaced it.


## Forcing a patch run out of cycle

**The emergency action, and the only thing in this backend that instructs a managed host to do
something it did not ask for.** The Installed Applications screen's "Patch now" raises one
`ForcedPatchRun` per host: run this application's upgrade script at your next opportunity, rather
than at your own next scheduled cycle. Five things about it are decisions rather than mechanics.

**The server still never pushes.** Nothing here opens a connection to a host — the one standing
socket in the system (remote control) is held by the per-user process, so it is absent on exactly
the headless servers an emergency is most likely to be about. A forced run is therefore a row an
agent *collects*, from `GET /api/forced-patch-runs` (agent-gated, and **in nginx's exact-match
regex** — that edit is part of the route, not a follow-up). The latency is the agent's own poll,
and the admin UI states it rather than implying otherwise.

**Reading consumes.** `ClaimForcedPatchRunsCommand` stamps every row it hands over as collected, in
the same call, which is why a GET writes. A row left collectable is served again on the next poll
sixty seconds later, and every serving starts a five-minute patching warning on that host. The cost
is stated rather than hidden: an agent collected from that then dies has lost the instruction, and
the operator presses the button again. That is the better failure of the two.

**It expires.** `ForcedPatchRun.DefaultLifetime` is 24 hours. A laptop shut in a bag for three weeks
would otherwise come back and start a five-minute countdown for an emergency that was over a
fortnight ago; 24 hours covers a headless server's hourly check-in many times over and dies with the
emergency that raised it.

**The browser names the hosts; this server does not re-derive them.** The screen's filters are
client-side, so the set the operator was looking at exists only in the browser —
`RequestForcedPatchRunsCommand` carries the host list. They arrive as *names*, because that is what
the Applications screen has (it has never carried a serial number), and translating a name to a host
id is a lookup rather than filter logic. A name that resolves to nothing comes back in
`NotRequested` rather than failing the call, and the handler reads `GetAllAsync`, which already
excludes a host whose removal has been requested.

**It is an urgency override, never a trust override.** The row carries an application name and a
platform bucket and nothing else — no script crosses either route. The agent re-fetches its ordinary
work list and `is_patchable` still verifies the signature against the key pinned at enrollment, so a
forced run cannot make an unsigned script runnable. Do not add a script, a signature, or a "skip the
check" flag to this shape; the admin UI disables the button on an unsigned row instead.

The agents' half — the third `patch_cycle` entry point, why it keeps the five-minute warning that
`run_now` skips, and why it does not register a completed cycle — is in `clients/CLAUDE.md`.


## When a script fails on a host: the Failed Updates queue

**A success and a failure are different kinds of fact, and they are stored differently.**
`ReportPatchResultCommand` records that an application reached a version — the server folds it into
its inventory and forgets it. `ReportPatchFailureCommand` (`POST /api/patch-failures`, agent-gated,
**and in nginx's exact-match regex**) records that a script ran and did not work, which is a piece of
work rather than a fact: somebody has to read the output and decide whether the script is wrong. So
it is an entity, `PatchFailure`, and the admin UI's Failed Updates screen is the queue it forms.

Four decisions there are worth knowing before changing any of it.

**One row per (host, application), not per attempt.** A patch cycle runs on a schedule, so a broken
script fails again every cycle forever; a row per attempt would bury the dozen distinct problems an
administrator can act on under thousands saying the same thing. `RecordAnotherFailure` folds a repeat
in, keeping the first and latest timestamps and a count — which is also the more useful reading,
since "failing since Tuesday, 40 times" is what separates a blip from a broken script. A row that has
been settled and starts failing again is `Reopen`ed rather than duplicated, so its history survives.

**`Platform` is resolved by the server, never sent by the agent.** It is an `UpgradePath` platform
*bucket* (see "Platform buckets" above), not an operating system, and it is half the key the failing
script is stored under. An agent deriving it from its own OS would send "macOS" for a Homebrew row and
the fix panel would load the wrong script or none. `ReportPatchFailureCommandHandler` calls
`IUpgradePathRepository.ResolveForHostAsync`, which runs the same `ResolvePath` that served that
agent its work list. Null when nothing resolves, which the screen shows as a failure it cannot offer
a fix for rather than hiding.

**The `Details` ceiling is a coupling with all three agents.** A failing script's stderr is unbounded.
`ReportPatchFailureCommandValidator.MaxDetailsLength` (16000, matching the column) has to stay
*above* each agent's `upgrade::MAX_REPORTED_FAILURE_BYTES` (4000): a report longer than the validator
accepts is answered with a 400 and the failure is lost silently, for precisely the noisiest failures.
Raise the server's figure before raising the agents', never after.

**The repair prompt is composed here, not in Dart.** `GetUpgradePathPromptQuery` takes an optional
`PatchFailureId`; when set, `PatchFailureRepairPrompt.Build` **appends** a brief — the failure's
output and the row's *current* script — to the ordinary research prompt. Appended rather than
substituted, and that is the whole design: the default prompt is where the `--update-version` /
`--update` CLI contract, the server-versus-host split and the response's JSON shape are stated, so a
replacement prompt gets back a fix that `ResearchApplicationUpgradePathCommandHandler` cannot parse,
or one that no longer honours the contract every agent invokes it by. Everything after that is the
existing flow unchanged — refresh with a prompt override, result persisted **unsigned**, a human
signs it. A package-manager row still gets no AI prompt (the reason string says so, as it always
has); hand-editing and re-signing it works exactly as on the Applications screen.

**Signing a repair clears the failures it addresses, and the scope is the path rather than the
row.** `SignUpgradePathScriptCommand` takes an optional `PatchFailureId`; when set — which only the
Failed Updates screen does — the handler resolves every outstanding failure for that
(application, platform) as `ScriptRepaired`, in the same save as the signature, and reports the count
so the screen can say the clearing reached other hosts rather than doing it silently. Three things
about that:

- **On sign, not on save.** An unsigned script is one no agent will run, so a fix that was saved and
  not signed leaves the failure entirely live. Only the signature replaces what was failing.
- **Path-scoped, not row-scoped.** A script is stored per (application, platform), not per host, so
  the signature that replaces a broken script replaces it for every machine that was failing on it.
  Clearing one row would leave the queue asserting the others are still broken by a script that no
  longer exists.
- **It claims nothing about whether the fix worked.** The next patch cycle decides that, and a
  repair that did not take is reported again and *reopens* the row with its original count and
  first-failed date intact. That is why `ScriptRepaired` is its own resolution rather than
  `Dismissed`: dismissing says "this will not happen again", this says "the thing that failed is
  gone, and we will find out".

Signing from the Applications screen passes no id and so clears nothing — that is an ordinary
review, which says nothing about whether anything was repaired.

**Nothing but a real execution failure belongs here.** An application with no signed patchable path,
the macOS daemon's `runs_as_root` refusal, an unreachable server — those are configuration problems
or have no script to fix, and a queue full of them hides the ones the AI can repair. The one
non-script row is a macOS install that actually ran and failed: the macOS agent files it under the
application name `macOS` (`os_update::OS_FAILURE_APPLICATION_NAME`), because a Mac that silently
never updated was the worse outcome, and the screen offers it no repair since there is no script to
repair. `ReportPatchResultCommandHandler` closes any outstanding failure for the same
(host, application), so a fixed script clears its own row; `ReportOperatingSystemPatchedCommandHandler`
does the same for the `macOS` row when the agent reports an install finished — which, for the
ordinary install that reboots the Mac from inside `softwareupdate`, the agent sends on its next start
(see `clients/macos-agent/CLAUDE.md`). Before it did, a macOS failure had no way off the screen but
the dismiss button. `DismissPatchFailureCommand` is for the ones that cannot recur.


## Verifying a server-written upgrade script

**Verifying it actually works.** `dotnet test` only asserts the shape
of the text; it never runs it. The scripts' `--update-version` mode is a few lines of `curl` against
a public catalog, so running it the way `CheckScriptVersionAsync` does costs seconds and is the only
thing that catches a script that is syntactically perfect and answers nothing:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/scripts":/w debian:12-slim \
    sh -c 'apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq curl && bash /w/flatpak.sh --appName Firefox --appId org.mozilla.firefox --update-version'
```

This is what caught `curl -fsSL -o /dev/null -w '%{redirect_url}'` returning an empty string — `-L`
makes curl *follow* the redirect, so the variable reporting the un-followed redirect is empty. That
one had shipped in the branch of the Homebrew script that answers for Homebrew itself and in the
prompt text recommending the pattern to the AI; nothing surfaced it, because the failure is a null
`LatestVersion`, which is indistinguishable from "no update available".


## One script per package manager

**Every package manager has one script, and the manager's own row is told apart at runtime.** Each
manager used to get two texts from `BuildScript(isSelfUpdate)` — `homebrew-self-update.sh` beside
`homebrew.sh`, `winget-self-update.ps1` beside `winget.ps1` — because the manager's own row needs
different handling from the applications it manages. That second text cost more than it bought: the
Applications screen nests every managed application under the manager's row and shows the manager's
script there once on behalf of all of them, which is only honest if the manager's bytes *are* its
children's bytes. So `RecognizedPackageManager.BuildScript` takes no argument, every builder returns
one text, and where the manager's row differs the *script* branches on `--appName` being the
manager's name — the name each agent reports the manager under (`system_info::HOMEBREW_NAME`,
`WINGET_NAME`, `FLATPAK_NAME`) and the rule `PrepareUpgradePathScanQueryHandler` recognizes the row by.
Homebrew is not a formula (GitHub's releases redirect for the version, `brew update` alone for the
upgrade); winget is not a winget package under its own name (the winget-cli releases redirect, and
`Microsoft.AppInstaller` is what gets upgraded); Flatpak is a distribution package (declines to answer
a version, upgrades through the distribution's own manager). Snap and Chocolatey need no branch at
all — snapd is a snap and `chocolatey` is a Chocolatey package, both reported under exactly that id.
Three things follow. `brew update` is Homebrew's own self-update as well as the index refresh, so on
macOS **every** application upgrade upgrades Homebrew too and the manager's row needs nothing more —
do not put a blanket `brew upgrade` back on it, which would patch every formula on the host regardless
of which rows a human has approved; the other managers get no such side effect, deliberately, since
upgrading App Installer from inside a running `winget` is not something to do on every package. One
signature now covers a manager and everything it manages, and `ApprovedScriptIdentity` publishes one
entry per manager, never a `-self-update` one. And a server upgraded across this change shows the old
self-update bytes on the Upgrade Scripts screen as a row with a newer server-written script, to be
taken and signed like any other — `PackageManagerDisplayName(…, isSelfUpdate: true)` survives only to
label those legacy rows.
