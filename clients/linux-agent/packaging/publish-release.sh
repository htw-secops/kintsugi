# Builds the release binary, bundles it with everything a brand-new install needs (config.toml,
# the systemd units, install.sh, uninstall.sh), and publishes that one bundle to the server.
#
# It does double duty: a human downloads it from the Clients page for a fresh install, and an
# already-enrolled agent's own auto-update check downloads the very same file and just extracts
# the "kintsugi-agent" entry out of it, ignoring the rest (see self_update.rs's extraction) — so
# there's only ever one artifact to build and publish, not two.
#
# The bundled config.toml's enrollment_token is left blank here on purpose: the server rewrites it
# to whatever AGENT_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN currently is on every download by a signed-in administrator,
# not just once at publish time — see AgentPackageArchiveRewriter — so a token rotation never makes
# an already-published package stale, and there's no --enrollment-token flag to remember to pass here.
#
# Publishing straight to a server (the default below, with no --output-dir) requires a signed-in
# administrator: POST /api/agent-packages carries [RequireAdminSession], so on a server with
# authentication enabled this curl needs that session's cookie, passed through PUBLISH_CURL_ARGS
# (e.g. PUBLISH_CURL_ARGS='--cookie .AspNetCore.Cookies=...'). The supported route is --output-dir,
# a GitHub release, and the Clients screen's "Refresh clients", which needs no cookie here at all.
#

#   packaging/publish-release.sh --api-base-url https://kintsugi.example.com:8443
#   packaging/publish-release.sh --release-notes "Fixes the snap list parser"
#
# The version published is always this crate's own Cargo.toml version — bump that first. Run from
# a plain (non-root) shell; unlike install.sh this never needs sudo, since it's talking to the
# server over the network, not touching this machine's systemd/filesystem.
#
# Build host note: the published binary must run on every distribution in the fleet, and a glibc
# binary only runs on a glibc at least as new as the one it was linked against. Build on the
# *oldest* distribution you support (or in a container of it) — this script does not pick a target
# for you.
#
# That note applies with full force to kintsugi-agent-wayland, and *only* to it once CI is doing the
# building: the agent itself is statically linked against musl there, so it has no libc floor at all,
# while the Wayland backend links libpipewire and therefore glibc and cannot. It is the one binary in
# this fleet with a floor. The consequence is confined rather than fatal — a host whose glibc is too
# old fails to exec it, the agent reports Wayland capture as unavailable, and everything else keeps
# working — but it is the reason CI builds that one on the oldest distribution it can.
#
# CI builds the binary itself — a universal one on macOS, a static musl one on Linux, neither of
# which a plain `cargo build --release` on the build host produces — and has no route to anyone's
# server. So both halves of this script are separable: --binary packages an already-built binary
# instead of building one, and --output-dir writes the tarball to a directory and stops before
# publishing. The tar invocation below stays the single owner of the archive's top-level entry
# names either way, because those names are what self_update.rs extracts by — reimplementing the
# `tar` call in a workflow file would let the two drift apart silently. See
# .github/workflows/release-clients.yml.
