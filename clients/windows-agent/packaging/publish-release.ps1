.SYNOPSIS
    Builds the release binary, bundles it with everything a brand-new install needs, and publishes
    that one bundle to the server.

.DESCRIPTION
    The counterpart to the macOS agent's packaging/publish-release.sh, and it does the same double
    duty: a human downloads the bundle from the Clients page for a fresh install, and an
    already-enrolled agent's own auto-update check downloads the very same file and just extracts
    the "kintsugi-agent.exe" entry out of it, ignoring the rest (see self_update.rs's extraction) -
    so there's only ever one artifact to build and publish, not two.

    The archive is a .tar.gz rather than a .zip, and that is load-bearing in two places: the server
    rewrites the archive's config.toml entry on every download (see AgentPackageArchiveRewriter,
    which reads gzip-tar specifically), and tar.exe has shipped in Windows since 10 1803 so
    extracting one needs nothing installed. Its top-level entry names matter too - self_update.rs
    looks for "kintsugi-agent.exe" by name.

    The bundled config.toml's enrollment_token is left blank on purpose: the server substitutes
    whatever AGENT_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN currently is on every download by a signed-in administrator,
    not just once at publish time, so a token rotation never makes an already-published package
    stale.

    Publishing straight to a server (no -OutputDir) requires a signed-in administrator: POST
    /api/agent-packages carries [RequireAdminSession], so on a server with authentication enabled
    the curl call needs that session's cookie, passed through -CurlArgs (e.g. -CurlArgs
    '--cookie','.AspNetCore.Cookies=...'). The supported route is -OutputDir, a GitHub release, and
    the Clients screen's "Refresh clients", which needs no cookie here at all.

    The version published is always this crate's own Cargo.toml version - bump that first. Run from
    a plain (non-elevated) shell; unlike install.ps1 this never needs administrator rights, since
    it's talking to the server over the network rather than touching this machine.

.EXAMPLE
    .\publish-release.ps1

.EXAMPLE
    .\publish-release.ps1 -ApiBaseUrl 'https://kintsugi.example.com:8443' -ReleaseNotes 'Fixes the winget listing parser'

.EXAMPLE
    .\publish-release.ps1 -OutputDir dist

    CI has no route to anyone's server, so the two halves of this script are separable: -Binary
    packages an already-built binary instead of running cargo, and -OutputDir writes the tarball to
    a directory and stops before publishing. The tar invocation below stays the single owner of the
    archive's top-level entry names either way, because those names are what self_update.rs
    extracts by - reimplementing the tar call in a workflow file would let the two drift apart
    silently. See .github/workflows/release-clients.yml.
