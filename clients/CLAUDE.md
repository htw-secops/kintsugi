# The three agents (`clients/`)

Loaded when Claude reads files under `clients/`. Each agent then has its own `CLAUDE.md` for what
its platform forced to differ; this file is what they share.

Read the macOS one first — it's the original — then the others for what each platform forced to
differ.

Two rules from the root `CLAUDE.md` bite hardest here. A new agent-facing route is un-gated until
`nginx/default.conf` is edited too, and nothing in the C# will tell you. And a version bump is half
a `Cargo.toml` edit and half a regenerated `Cargo.lock`: CI passes `--locked` everywhere, so a bump
missing the lock file dies before compiling, the release job never fires, and the tag is silently
never cut. Verify with `cargo test --locked`, which is the invocation CI uses.

## Building and testing

```bash
# macOS agent (inline #[cfg(test)] modules — checkin_schedule, identity, self_update, ...)
# Once, ever: mints the fleet code-signing identity straight into this repository's Actions secrets,
# which is what keeps a host's Screen Recording and Accessibility grants across releases. Nothing
# local holds the key. See "One certificate signs every build" in clients/macos-agent/CLAUDE.md.
clients/macos-agent/packaging/create-signing-identity.sh --set-secrets
cd clients/macos-agent && cargo build --release
cd clients/macos-agent && cargo test
cd clients/macos-agent && cargo test load_or_assign_persists_a_fresh_minute_when_nothing_is_saved_yet


# Windows agent — same shape, but it only builds on Windows (winreg, windows-sys, windows-service)
cd clients/windows-agent && cargo build --release
cd clients/windows-agent && cargo test


# Linux agent — same shape again. Builds and tests natively on Linux; from macOS, run it in a
# container (see clients/linux-agent/CLAUDE.md), a real Linux build rather than a cross-compile.
cd clients/linux-agent && cargo build --release
cd clients/linux-agent && cargo test


# The Linux agent's Wayland backend, which is its own crate because it links libpipewire (see
# "Couplings"). Needs libpipewire-0.3-dev >= 0.3.65 — debian:12 or newer, not ubuntu:22.04.
cd clients/linux-agent-wayland && cargo test
```

**The lock file is half the bump, and forgetting it fails after the merge rather than before it.**
A crate's own version is recorded in its `Cargo.lock` as well as its `Cargo.toml`, and every cargo
invocation in CI passes `--locked` (`ci.yml:122`, `190-191`, `228`, `275`) — which exists precisely
to refuse a lock file that doesn't match. So a bump that touches only `Cargo.toml` dies at
`error: cannot update the lock file ... because --locked was passed`, *before compiling anything*.
The failure reads as "the agent tests failed" when the tests never ran, and because it stops at the
test step the release job never fires, so the tag is silently never cut. A bare `cargo test` will
not reproduce it — the flag is the whole difference — so verify a bump with the same invocation CI
uses:

```bash
cd clients/<platform>-agent && cargo test --locked
```

Running any ordinary `cargo build`/`test`/`check` after editing the version updates the lock file in
passing; the trap is doing that in a scratch copy of the tree and committing only from the original.

Each publish script still works by hand and is still the only place the archive's layout is
defined; CI calls the same script with `--binary`/`--output-dir` (`-Binary`/`-OutputDir` on
Windows) so the `tar` invocation is never duplicated in YAML. Run one directly and it builds and
POSTs to `/api/agent-packages` as before. The Linux one must then be run on the *oldest* glibc in
the fleet (or a container of it): a binary linked against a newer glibc will not start on an older
host, and nothing in the publish path checks that. **CI sidesteps that entirely** by targeting
`x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` — statically linked, so there is no libc floor at all, which is only
possible because the agent links no C library of its own (rustls links nothing; `ksni` speaks
StatusNotifierItem over zbus rather than linking GTK). It asserts the result is not dynamically
linked rather than trusting the target name. macOS gets a `lipo`'d universal binary for the same
reason there is one package per platform: an arm64-only build would silently exclude every Intel
Mac in the fleet.

## The three agents

They are deliberately the same program in different clothes: same modules, same names, same
ordering, same comments where the reasoning carries over. Read the macOS one first — it's the
original — then the others for what each platform forced to differ. The differences that matter:

| | macOS | Windows | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| Privileged half | root LaunchDaemon, re-invoked by launchd | resident service (`windows-service`) | systemd oneshot on a `.timer` |
| Per-user half | LaunchAgent | logon-triggered task for `BUILTIN\Users` | systemd user unit, `graphical-session.target` |
| Check-in schedule | rewrites its own plist, reloads launchd via a detached helper | computes its next wake in-process | rewrites its own `.timer`, `daemon-reload` |
| Privilege handoff | queue: OS download, OS install, AI-researched scripts and App Store rows; Homebrew stays per-user, and a `pkg` cask leaves Homebrew to become an AI-researched row (see the macOS `CLAUDE.md`) | queue, everything | queue, everything |
| Inventory | `/Applications` bundles + Homebrew + App Store (by receipt) | uninstall registry (3 views) + winget + Chocolatey | Flatpak + Snap as *applications*; dpkg/rpm reported separately as packages (see below) |
| OS updates | `softwareupdate` | Windows Update Agent COM API, via PowerShell | apt / dnf / yum / zypper / pacman / apk |
| Host identity | hardware serial, always present | SMBIOS serial, **often a placeholder** | DMI serial, **often a placeholder** |
| Nobody logged in | nothing patches | nothing patches | root service patches unattended — see below |
| Remote control | per-user process, consent + capture + input | service holds the socket, a **SYSTEM session helper** does the rest, named pipe between | resident root unit holds the socket, per-user process does the rest, unix socket between; X11 via XTEST, Wayland via a separate portal/PipeWire binary |
| Choosing a display | restarts the ScreenCaptureKit stream on another `SCDisplay` | a source rectangle of the whole virtual desktop, plus "All displays" | X11: a crop of the root window, plus "All displays". Wayland: whichever outputs the portal's picker granted, re-linked to a different PipeWire node |
| Remote shell | a third root LaunchDaemon, as **root**, asked by the per-user process through its own queue | the service itself, as **SYSTEM**, over ConPTY — no helper | the resident root unit, as **root** — nothing crosses `remote_ipc` |
| Reachable with nobody logged in | no — the per-user process holds the identity | yes, for a shell; a screen request answers `Unavailable` | yes, for a shell; a screen request answers `Unavailable` |


**Linux borrows its architecture from Windows, not macOS, and for the same forcing reason.** Every
upgrade it can perform (`apt-get`, `dnf`, `flatpak update --system`, `snap refresh`) requires root,
so patching lives in the root service and the per-user process holds no identity and makes **no
network call at all** — it decides *when*, and asks. macOS is the odd one out precisely because
Homebrew *refuses* to run as root and installs into a user-writable prefix. The queue directory is
`root:root 1733` (a drop-box: anyone may write, only root may read or list), which is the Linux
spelling of the macOS queue's `root:admin 0770` and needs no group — "local administrators" is
`sudo` on Debian, `wheel` on Red Hat, and neither elsewhere. "Anyone may write" is why the root
side trusts nothing about an entry but what it reads from the opened file: every entry is opened
`O_NOFOLLOW|O_NONBLOCK` and must be a regular file, a request is acted on only if its owner has a
login session (`/run/user/<uid>`), a result is written fresh under a name root has just unlinked,
and the per-user side believes a result only if the queue directory's owner wrote it. A
penetration test triggered a root `apt-get upgrade` from an unprivileged account and showed the
symlink cases were being held off only by the kernel's `fs.protected_symlinks` default;
`queue.rs`'s module docs name each check. What that does *not* change: a logged-in user can still
ask for an OS update or an early run of an already-signed script, which is "Patch Now".


**macOS hands off by row, and `upgrade::runs_as_root` is the one place that decision lives.** The
per-user process runs a Homebrew row itself — `brew` refuses to run as root and its installs are
user-owned — and sends an AI-researched row (`UpgradeStatusDto.PackageManager` null) to the root
daemon through the same queue OS updates use. It has to: the prompt tells those scripts to replace
the bundle under `/Applications` or run `installer -pkg ... -target /`, and a bundle that arrived by
MDM or any installer that asked for a password is `root:wheel`. Run as the logged-in user, the
script's `rm` printed `Permission denied` for every file in `Ollama.app` and left the old version in
place, while the log called it a script failure. The queue keeps its one security property in both
directions — an app-patch request carries a name, the daemon re-fetches the row, verifies the
signature and re-asks `runs_as_root` itself, so a forged request can neither run arbitrary code nor
get `brew` run as root — and a request older than its kind's `RequestKind::timeout()` or from before
the current boot is discarded unrun, because the process that would have shown progress for it is
gone.

**That timeout is per-kind because one number could not serve all three, and the shared one shipped
too short.** Both sides read it from `RequestKind::timeout()` — `submit` blocks for that long,
`is_stale` discards past it — and splitting them means the daemon throwing away requests their
owners are still holding. An hour was right for an application and wrong for a macOS install: a real
run spent 80 minutes merely *downloading*, the per-user half gave up at exactly 3600s with "timed out
waiting for the root daemon to answer a OsUpdate request", and the daemon wrote an answer twenty
minutes later that nobody was left to read. `OS_UPDATE_TIMEOUT` is six hours. The answer nobody read
also stayed on disk forever, at 109KB — `submit` removes its *request* on timeout but cannot remove a
result that had not been written yet, so `sweep_orphans` is what finally collects those.
The prompt now describes that context (root, a LaunchDaemon, no GUI session — quit the application
via `launchctl asuser`, never relaunch it), so a script is generated for the process that runs it.
An App Store row (`PackageManager` "App Store") goes to the daemon too, for the reason under
"Platform buckets": the install half needs root and the download half needs the console user's
session, and only root can be both.


**"No network call at all" includes the patching policy, and 0.5.0 got that wrong.**
`/api/patching-policy` sits inside nginx's client-certificate regex, so there is no such thing as
fetching it without an identity — but the Linux per-user process tried, under a comment asserting
the route was ungated. Every Linux host with a graphical session therefore 403'd once a minute
forever while the root service, having deferred to that process, patched nothing; the host went on
reporting healthy check-ins the whole time, and the symptom only appears on day two because a
freshly enrolled host isn't due until then. The fix is the Windows arrangement, which had it right:
the root service fetches the policy on **every** check-in — before registration, and regardless of
whether it then defers — and writes `/var/lib/kintsugi-agent/policy.json` `0644`; the per-user
process only ever `policy::load_cached`es it. Keep `fetch` private to the root side on both
platforms, and don't reintroduce a per-user fetch of anything.


**All three block until a policy arrives, and what that costs differs by where the fetch sits in
the check-in.** The per-user process cannot fetch one itself on Windows or Linux, so it waits on the
cache the root half writes. Windows refreshes the policy **last**, after the heartbeat, the host
registration and the inventory have all succeeded, so *any* earlier failure leaves no cache at all;
Linux refreshes it **first**, before registration and unconditionally, precisely so a later failure
cannot starve the per-user side (the comment in `register_and_report` says so). The residue on Linux
is therefore only a first-ever check-in whose policy GET itself failed with nothing cached — narrow,
where Windows' was wide. macOS fetches for itself, since its per-user process holds the identity,
so its wait is a fresh install's alone: the LaunchAgent starts beside the root daemon, the daemon has
not enrolled yet, and with no cache every fetch draws a 403.

**Narrow or wide, the wait used to be invisible, and that is what was fixed.** Both waits sat
*ahead* of `tray_menu::run`, so until a policy arrived there was no notification-area icon at all —
no error, no waiting state, nothing but a line in `agent.log` — and the next check-in was an hour
away. On a host dropping about 40% of its connections that reads as an agent that never installed.
Windows 0.11.2, Linux 0.12.1 and macOS 0.17.2 all put the icon up first and run the wait on the
scheduler thread reporting `AgentStatus::WaitingForPolicy`, with "Check In Now" left clickable — it
is the one action that ends the state, so the wait services `menu_rx` rather than sleeping — and
"Patch Now" greyed.
Linux's wait keeps calling `queue::record_heartbeat` on every tick, which is not decoration: it is
what stops the root service patching behind a per-user process that is present but not yet ready.
macOS shipped the same invisible wait with a worse ending: its HTTP client was built once, from
whatever identity was on disk at startup, so even after the daemon enrolled every request still
went out certless — *every* first install sat iconless for good, until somebody restarted the
LaunchAgent. `main::refresh_identity` now rebuilds the client whenever the identity on disk appears
or changes, in the wait and in `run_scheduler` alike — *changes* because re-enrolling after a
regenerated CA left a running process presenting the old certificate, the same silent 403.

**The matching retry could not be shared, because the root halves are shaped differently.** Windows
is a resident service, so `service::retry_delay` just schedules its next wake at 2/5/15 minutes
before falling back to the hour. Linux is a `Type=oneshot` on a timer and systemd refuses `Restart=`
on a oneshot, so `main::retry_delay` runs the same schedule *inside* the invocation — releasing the
privileged `flock` between attempts, or a queue-triggered patch would wait out the whole backoff —
and gated on `policy::load_cached` still being empty rather than on the attempt having errored. That
gate is load-bearing twice over: it states the purpose, and since `check_in` runs
`patch_unattended_if_nobody_is_logged_in` (hours, potentially) and that cycle no-ops without a
policy, it makes the retry provably unable to repeat a check-in that patched anything. The 22-minute
total is bounded by the hour between timer firings, which a test pins. macOS has no such retry.


**"Next check-in" is a prediction the per-user process makes from a root-written file, and "Check
In Now" is a queue request.** The menu's check-in line is `checkin_schedule::next_check_in_epoch`:
the next occurrence of the minute in `checkin-schedule.json`, which only the root half writes.
That file therefore has to be readable by the per-user process on all three platforms — root's
`0644` umask into a `0755` directory on macOS, an explicit `0644` in the Linux `persist` (the state
directory is traverse-only, so the mode on the file is all there is, exactly as for `policy.json`),
and `%ProgramData%`'s inherited `Users` read on Windows. It shows "not yet scheduled" until the
first check-in writes it. The scheduler re-reads it every tick and pushes it to the menu only when
it changes, because `format_due` shells out for the local time. "Check In Now" is
`RequestKind::CheckIn`, carrying nothing — the root half re-registers, re-reports the inventory and
runs `self_update`, which is everything it would do at the hour, so the worst a forged request does
is a check-in early. What answers it differs by platform in a way worth knowing before debugging
one: on macOS the file is only a *wake-up* — `WatchPaths` starts the daemon, every daemon
invocation *is* a check-in, and `DaemonRequestHandler::check_in` merely confirms work already done
before the queue was reached — whereas the Windows service (`Agent::check_in`) and the Linux queue
service (`main::check_in`, under the lock it already holds) run the check-in *inside* the request.
If that check-in installs a newer agent, the per-user process asking is restarted before it can
read the answer; the new version in the menu is the confirmation. Both action items are greyed out
while either a patch cycle or a check-in is running, because a cycle owns the schedule state for its
whole length (see below) and the scheduler cannot start a second one while it does.


**A patch cycle runs on its own thread, and the confirmation dialog is why.** All three schedulers
used to call `patch_cycle::run` inline, so the loop was parked inside a dialog that stands there for
a whole delay period — hours. Three things went wrong while it was, and only the first is obvious:
the menu's "Next check-in" line stopped updating; a menu click sat in the channel until the dialog
came down and then ran unasked, which is exactly what the greying above exists to prevent; and on
Linux the per-user heartbeat lapsed after `queue::HEARTBEAT_MAX_AGE` (ten minutes), so the root
service concluded nobody was logged in and **patched unattended under a user who had the prompt
open**. `main::spawn_cycle` hands the cycle its own thread, and hands it the `ScheduleState` by
*ownership* rather than behind a lock — a mutex held for the length of a dialog would have moved the
block rather than removed it, since `is_due` would then be the thing waiting. So `state` being `None`
in the scheduler loop *is* "a cycle is in flight", the join site is where the state comes back, and
`AgentStatus::AwaitingAnswer` is what greys "Patch Now" while a prompt is on screen without opening
the progress window over it. Keep the three copies in step; the shape is identical and only the
arguments a cycle needs differ.


**A forced patch run is a third entry point into `patch_cycle`, and it answers two questions
differently from both the others.** An administrator can raise "patch this application now" against
a host from the admin UI's Installed Applications screen; the server's half is in `src/CLAUDE.md`.
`patch_cycle::run_forced` — kept in all three, like `run` and `run_now` — is what runs it:

- **No confirm/delay dialog.** That dialog exists so the person at the desk can move an *automatic*
  cycle out of the way. Somebody has already decided the emergency outranks the interruption, so
  offering "Delay" would offer something the answer to has been given. This is the whole of what the
  feature is for.
- **The full five-minute warning all the same.** `run_now` skips it because the click came from the
  very person the interruption falls on (see `Decision`); that reasoning does not hold when the
  person deciding is somewhere else. The host gets the same notice a scheduled cycle gives, with
  nothing to click.
- **Narrowed to the named applications, and the OS update dropped with them.** "Force this
  application" names one row on one screen; installing every other pending patch and a reboot-bearing
  OS update would do enormously more than was asked, in the situation where the person asking can
  least absorb the surprise. That is `narrowed_to`, on `PendingWork` on macOS and on `Plan` in the
  other two, because that is where each agent's version of the type lives.
- **`register_completed` is not called.** A forced run patches one application; the scheduled cycle
  patches everything. Counting it as the cycle would push the real one a whole interval out, so an
  emergency patch would silently cost the host its next ordinary one. `execute`'s `reschedule`
  argument is what says so, and it is the only argument that differs between the three entry points.

**How the instruction is collected differs by platform, and so does how often — which is the one
place these three deliberately do not match.** The reason is the same one that decides everything
else in the table above: which half of the agent holds an identity.

| | macOS | Windows | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| Who asks the server | per-user process, directly | the service, asked over the queue | the root side, asked over the queue |
| Where the poll runs | inline in the scheduler loop | its own thread (`spawn_poller`) | its own thread (`spawn_poller`) |
| How often | every tick (60s) | every tick (60s) | every `forced_patch_run::POLL_INTERVAL` (5 min) |
| Nobody logged in | never collected | never collected | collected at the hourly check-in, run unattended |

macOS polls inline because it is one HTTP call, beside the policy fetch already there. The other two
cannot: their per-user half holds no identity, so a poll is a queue round trip —
`RequestKind::ForcedPatchRuns`, answered by the privileged side — and a queue round trip is slow
enough that running it on the loop that also answers a tray click is the exact problem `spawn_cycle`
exists to avoid. Linux polls a fifth as often because its queue is watched by a `.path` unit, so
every poll *starts a systemd unit*: once a minute is 1440 unit activations a day on every desktop,
which reads as a broken agent long before anybody reads the lines. Very little is lost — the cycle
it starts then waits five minutes before patching anything.

Because those two threads keep collecting while a cycle is in flight, and the server hands an
instruction over exactly once, both buffer what they collect (`run_scheduler`'s `pending_forced`)
rather than reading the channel only when the schedule state happens to be free.

**A forced run cannot run an unsigned script**, on any platform. The instruction carries a name; the
work list is re-fetched and `is_patchable` re-verifies the signature exactly as for a scheduled
cycle. Do not add a script or a bypass to `ForcedPatchRun` — it is an urgency override, not a trust
override, and the queue's own property (a request names a thing, the privileged side fetches and
verifies it) is the same one.


**Only the Linux agent patches with nobody logged in, and it has to.** Both other agents put the
patching schedule in the per-user process, which costs nothing when every managed host is somebody's
desktop. Most of a Linux fleet is servers with no graphical session at all, so the same design would
mean the majority of hosts silently never patched. The per-user process writes a heartbeat into the
queue directory (`queue::record_heartbeat`); when the root service's hourly check-in finds none
recent, it runs the cycle itself with the confirm/delay/warning steps dropped rather than faked —
there is nobody to ask. The per-user process exits immediately when it has no `DISPLAY`, so an SSH
login can't suppress a server's own patching by leaving a heartbeat behind. Nor can a file: a
heartbeat counts only if it is owned by the uid its name carries, that uid has a login session, and
its timestamp is no further ahead of the clock than `HEARTBEAT_MAX_AGE` — a forged
`ui-424242.heartbeat` with `touch -d` into next year read as "0s ago" on every check-in, for ever,
before those three checks existed (`queue::live_ui_agent_with`).

**A signed script is staged where only the process running it can write, and its arguments are
checked.** Linux stages under `/var/lib/kintsugi-agent/scripts` and macOS under
`/Library/Application Support/kintsugi-agent/scripts` as root (or the per-user state directory for
a Homebrew row), both `0700` and created `O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW`; Windows stages in SYSTEM's own
`%TEMP%`, where creating a symlink needs a privilege ordinary users lack. macOS staged in `/tmp`
on the reasoning that its scripts ran as the logged-in user, which stopped being true when
`runs_as_root` sent AI-researched rows to the daemon — a root process writing a predictable name
into a world-writable directory is a local-root race. And the signature covers the script text, not
the `--appName`/`--appId` it is handed, so `reject_unsafe_script_argument` (mirrored in all three)
refuses a value with a path separator, a control character or a dot entry before any script sees
it; every approved script interpolates `--appName` into a path.


**Windows and Linux serial numbers are frequently placeholders.** `HKLM\HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\BIOS`
and `/sys/class/dmi/id/product_serial` read the same SMBIOS field and inherit the same junk from board
vendors: "To Be Filled By O.E.M.", "Default string", "0", "Not Specified" (which is what every guest
of a bare `qemu-system-x86_64` reports). The serial *is* this host's identity — it becomes the
certificate CN, which `[RequireAgentIdentity]` compares against every request body — so two hosts
sharing one would share a host record, a certificate, and each other's data.
`system_info::serial_number` in both agents therefore screens against a placeholder list and
**refuses to enroll** rather than inventing a value. macOS has no equivalent failure mode.


**Every request an agent makes is retried, and for a long time only the POSTs were.**
`post_with_retry` has been there since the beginning, so an intermittently lossy path between a host
and the server is invisible on enrollment, inventory and patch results — and every GET beside it had
exactly one attempt. On one host that cost a whole patch cycle to a bad minute:
`upgrade::fetch_upgrade_statuses` is called once per application, deliberately, so five applications
in a row each spent the client's full 15s timeout and reported "operation timed out". `get_with_retry`
now sits next to `post_with_retry` in the same file, and its budget is deliberately different — a
POST reports something that has already happened and can afford minutes of backoff, a GET is holding
up a patch cycle somebody is watching, so it takes a short per-attempt timeout and a short delay. The
one GET left un-retried is the self-update *download*, because its client's timeout is sized for a
multi-megabyte transfer and a short per-attempt budget would cut a healthy one short; it says so.
This is the same asymmetry `remote_control`'s session socket had, in a third place — if you are
adding a request to an agent, the question to ask is what happens to it when one SYN is dropped.


**Replacing a running binary differs.** macOS and Linux stage next to the target and rename over it
(atomic, and Unix will unlink an open file). Windows locks a running image, so `self_update` renames
the *old* binary aside — which Windows does allow — copies the new one into the freed path, and
deletes the displaced copy at next service start. It restores the old one if the copy fails; leaving
the path empty would break the agent permanently. Linux also has nothing to restart on the root
side: it is a oneshot that is about to exit, and the next timer firing execs whatever is at the path
by then — only the long-running per-user units get restarted.


## Reporting a failed upgrade

A patch that *works* is reported by `upgrade::report_patch_result`; one that runs and **fails** is
reported by `upgrade::report_patch_failure`, to `POST /api/patch-failures`, and turns up on the admin
UI's Failed Updates screen with the date, the count and the command's captured output. The server's
half is in `src/CLAUDE.md`. Three things about the agents' half.

**Whichever process ran the script reports it, and only that one.** The Linux service
(`main::ServiceHandler::patch_application`) and the Windows service
(`service::AgentService::patch_application`) are each the single place `patch_one` ever runs, so both
report from there and their per-user halves — which reach patching only through `queue` — report
nothing. macOS is the one that has to choose, because it genuinely has two runners: the root daemon
runs AI-researched and App Store rows, the per-user process runs Homebrew ones (see `runs_as_root`).
So `main::DaemonRequestHandler::patch_application` reports its own, and `patch_cycle::run_patches`
reports only when `ran_by_the_daemon` is false. Reporting in both places would record every root-run
failure twice.

**Only a real execution failure is reported.** Everything reachable *before* `patch_one` — no
enrolled identity, no signed patchable path, the daemon's `runs_as_root` refusal, an unreachable
server — is a configuration problem rather than a bug in a script, and a screen full of those hides
the ones a human or the AI can actually fix. Each call site says so in a comment; keep them saying
it.

**An OS update that *ran* and failed is reported, under the application name `macOS`.** It used to be
excluded on the reasoning that there is no script to repair — true, but it meant the failure was
logged on the host and nowhere else, so the admin UI showed a Mac that simply never updated with no
indication why. The authorization wall in `clients/macos-agent/CLAUDE.md` sat unreported for a day
for exactly that reason. It goes through the existing `/api/patch-failures` route rather than a new
one: that route is already in nginx's agent-certificate regex and already carries
`[RequireAgentIdentity]`, and `ReportPatchFailureCommandHandler` already files a name that resolves
to no upgrade path with a null platform — which the screen renders as a failure it cannot offer a
repair for, which is precisely right here. The rule above still holds for everything that never ran:
an unauthorized or declined OS update is logged, not reported.

**`MAX_REPORTED_FAILURE_BYTES` has to stay below the server's own ceiling.** A failing script's
stderr is unbounded and `run_script` bails with all of it. 4000 bytes here against
`ReportPatchFailureCommandValidator.MaxDetailsLength`'s 16000 there — a report longer than the
validator accepts is answered with a 400 and the failure is lost silently, for exactly the noisiest
failures. `truncate_for_report` keeps the **tail** rather than the head (a script's last words are
where its failure is; its first are the preamble every run prints) and walks to a char boundary, the
same as `truncate_for_log`. Identical in all three agents, tests included.

**`failedUtc` is the host's own clock.** A machine that patched overnight and could not reach the
server until morning would otherwise report the failure as having happened when the network came
back. Formatted RFC 3339 via `time`, which all three agents already carry for logging.


## Remote control: what the three agents share

The server's half is in `src/CLAUDE.md`, the viewer's in `web/CLAUDE.md`. The timeout orderings
between agent and server, and the media protocol's hand-mirrored wire format, are path-scoped rules
under `.claude/rules/` that load when you open the file at either end.

An administrator can take control of a host's screen, keyboard and mouse from the Hosts screen's
Connect action, or open a **terminal** on it from the Terminal action beside it. Both are the same
session underneath — one request, one relay, one audit row — and `RemoteControlSessionKind` on the
wire is the whole of the difference.

**A shell session asks nobody, and that is the deliberate exception to everything below.** It is
the access an administrator of this fleet already has by other means — it is what they would reach
SSH or a remote PowerShell session for — and the only reason it is routed through this agent is
that SSH would need an inbound port on every managed machine, which is exactly what the relay
design exists to avoid. So it reports `RemoteControlConsent.NotRequired` in place of a decision,
and the compensating control is that the same `remote_control_sessions` row a screen request writes
is written for it, naming who asked and when. Three things follow and none of them is optional.
`NotRequired` is accepted **only** for a shell, checked in `RemoteControlSession.RecordConsent` and
again in `RemoteControlRelaySession.LatchConsent` — the second is not belt-and-braces, it is the
latch the socket gate actually reads, so enforcing it in the entity alone would let an agent open
*capture, keyboard and pointer* on a host shown no dialog simply by claiming no permission was
needed. The shell always runs as the account that already holds this host's fleet identity —
**root** on macOS and Linux, **SYSTEM** on Windows, and **never the logged-in user on any
platform** — which is what makes "nobody is asked" defensible: it is not a session inside somebody
else's desktop, it is the administrative access an SSH key would already give. It is stated on the
wire (`ShellInfo.user`) and shown in the viewer rather than left to be remembered, so a host that
ever answered with a user account would be visible as the different thing it is.


**A terminal needs no desktop, and decoupling that from reachability is what makes the feature
useful.** Both the Linux and Windows agents used to hold their control socket *only* while somebody
was logged in, so "reachable" meant "somebody is sitting at a desktop". That is right for a screen
session and quite wrong for a shell: most of a Linux fleet is servers with no graphical session at
all, and those are precisely the hosts an administrator wants a terminal on. Both now hold the
socket whenever the host has an identity, treat the desktop as a *capability* rather than a
precondition, and answer a screen request that arrives without one with
`ConsentOutcome::Unavailable` — the agent saying "there is nobody here" at once, rather than the
host being invisible and the administrator being told the agent is unreachable. **macOS is still unreachable with nobody logged
in**, for both kinds: its *control* socket is held by the per-user process, so there is nothing to
receive the request in the first place. Only the shell's execution moved to root, not the
negotiation — moving the control socket too would mean porting the Linux split (root holds the
socket, per-user connects back over a local one) to macOS wholesale.

The PTY runs in whichever process already holds the identity and needs no helper: the resident root
unit on Linux (no `remote_ipc` hop — nothing crosses it for a shell) and the **service itself** on
Windows via ConPTY, with no `session_launcher` and no SYSTEM session helper. Everything the Windows
helper exists for is about a desktop, and requiring one would put a logged-in user back in the way of
the host most likely to want a shell.


**Neither socket is new, and no nginx change was needed.** A shell session uses the same standing
control socket and the same per-session media socket a screen session does; the media protocol
gained two message kinds and one text message and nothing else. Keep it that way — a
`/api/admin/remote-shell` location would be a second thing to keep in step with the agent regex for
no gain.

The rest of this section is about **screen** sessions, which are the ones with a consent rule.


**Nothing happens until the person at the keyboard says yes.** The whole feature rests on three
properties, and none of them is optional or configurable: consent is asked for every session and
names the requesting administrator; silence is a refusal; and while a session runs it is visible in
the menu bar with a way to end it. A fourth, durable one sits behind them —
`remote_control_sessions` records every *request*, including the refused ones, the timed-out ones
and the ones against a host that never answered, because "an administrator asked to watch this
laptop and was told no" is precisely the event an auditor is looking for.


**The control socket is standing, and it is the only push channel in the system.** Everything else
an agent does is a request it makes when it has something to say; remote control is the one case
where the server has to reach a host, and an hourly check-in cannot carry "somebody would like to
see your screen now". So the per-user process holds one socket open for its life, with reconnect
backoff. Sessions get their own socket so a frame stream can never queue behind a control message,
and so a session dropping does not cost the host its reachability.


**A session socket gets one chance where the control socket gets unlimited ones, and that asymmetry
hid a flaky link for months.** The control socket's connect sits in a reconnect loop, so a connect
that times out costs a log line and a few seconds of backoff before it succeeds — a host whose SYNs
to the server are intermittently blackholed reports healthy check-ins, holds a live control socket
and looks entirely well. A session socket was a single `connect`, so the *same* packet loss ended
the session with "could not connect", and a screen session tried a minute later would work,
"proving" the network was fine. That is exactly how one Windows host presented: terminal sessions
failing, screen sessions succeeding, `Test-NetConnection` succeeding, and two `connection timed out`
lines against the control socket in the log that nobody had reason to read. So all three agents
retry the session connect (`connect_session_socket`), with a per-attempt timeout deliberately
*shorter* than the control socket's — a blackholed SYN is not answered by waiting longer, it is
answered by a fresh connection — and the whole budget is held inside the server's pairing window by
a test. Log the peer address when changing any of this: `remote control socket open to {url}` named
no address, which is why the diagnosis needed a support call rather than the log.


**Consent timeouts have the opposite polarity to patching, and the code keeps them apart.**
`dialogs::ConfirmChoice::TimedOut` means "nobody was at the desk, so count it as a delay" — the
user never refused and patching happens regardless. `RemoteControlChoice::TimedOut` means **nobody
consented**, and is treated exactly as a refusal. They are separate enums for that reason; reusing
the first would have put the safe default one careless `match` arm away. The dialog's default button
is Deny for the same reason, since AppleScript reports the default button as `button returned:` even
when it dismissed the dialog itself.


**A delay the dialog spent waiting is not a delay to be served again, and getting that wrong made
the countdown twice as long as the policy says.** The confirmation dialog's giveup *is* one delay
period (`patch_cycle` passes `policy.delay_seconds()` as the timeout), so by the time it fires, the
time a delay buys has already been spent. `register_delay` — right for an explicit "Delay" click,
which asks for a fresh period — then postponed by another one on top, so eight one-hour delays
counted down over sixteen hours: dialog for an hour, an hour of nothing, dialog again with the
count decremented. `ScheduleState::register_unanswered_prompt` is the unanswered case instead: it
charges the budget for however many whole delay periods actually elapsed while the dialog stood
there, and leaves the cycle due *now*, so the next poll tick re-asks at once and the count falls
8 → 7 → 6 once per period. Crediting elapsed periods rather than assuming one is what covers sleep
— a machine that slept with the dialog open wakes to have the prompt taken down within seconds (see
below), and spends the delays that passed rather than starting them again. The budget running out
needs no special case: the next tick finds `can_delay` false and shows the "no delays left" dialog,
which is where the five-minute notice comes from. **That dialog is the warning rather than a
preamble to it**: it states the period, stands there for as much of it as the user leaves it up, and
`remaining_warning` hands `execute` whatever is left, so the notice is five minutes in total —
somebody who reads it and clicks OK still gets the rest of the period, and a host with nobody at it
waits five minutes instead of the ten that showing both in series cost. Nothing here is a running
timer — `is_due` compares wall clock against a persisted absolute epoch, which is why sleep,
hibernation and a restart all need no wake detection.

**The dialog's deadline is the agent's, on the wall clock, because every dialog program's own timer
stops when the machine sleeps.** "Wakes to a giveup that fires immediately" was the assumption
above until it was measured: on this fleet's own Mac a confirm dialog raised with a one-hour
`giving up after` on a Friday morning was still up, still offering all eight delays, on the Monday,
and gave up **seventy-one hours** after it went up — five minutes into that morning's session, the
lid having been open for two minutes on the Sunday and five on the Monday in between. AppleScript's
clause counts time the Mac spent running, dark wakes included, and nothing else; zenity's
`--timeout` is a GLib timeout on `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`, which Linux stops during suspend; Windows'
`SetTimer` is documented to include sleep, and is not relied on either. So every dialog in all three
`dialogs.rs` is now held to `shown_at + delay_seconds` on `now_epoch` by the agent itself — macOS
and Linux spawn the dialog program and poll it every five seconds, killing it once the deadline
has passed (`run_osascript_until`, `run_until`); Windows makes its `WM_TIMER` a five-second poll
against a thread-local deadline (`DEADLINE_POLL_MS`) — and the program's own timeout is kept only
as the clean way down while the machine stays awake. Linux's kdialog path dropped coreutils'
`timeout` with this: the agent's kill is the timeout, and one fewer program has to be installed.

**And a cycle only starts to a screen somebody can see, because a wall-clock deadline makes the
opposite worse.** The per-user process ticks during macOS's Power Nap dark wakes, and that is
where the Friday prompt came from: raised at 08:47 to a lid that had been shut for five minutes.
With the deadline on the wall clock, that prompt would have spent the whole eight-hour budget behind
the closed lid and the person would have opened it to "patching will begin in 5 minutes" without
ever having been offered a delay. So `main::prompt_can_be_seen` asks `presence::obstruction` before
starting an *automatic* cycle and holds the cycle — logging once when the hold begins and once when
it lifts — while the screen cannot be seen. What "cannot be seen" means is whatever each platform
can actually read, and each `presence.rs` says why: macOS asks the window server whether the main
display is asleep, whether the screen is locked and whether this session owns the console; Windows
asks the input desktop (locked), the console display's power state (`GUID_CONSOLE_DISPLAY_STATE`
notifications the tray window registers for) and the screen saver; Linux asks logind's `LockedHint`
over `busctl` and, on X11, DPMS. Every check fails towards "nothing in the way", which is the
behaviour the agents had before it existed. "Patch Now" and a forced run are not gated: one is a
click, the other an administrator's decision that shows nothing needing an answer. Neither is the
Linux root service's unattended cycle, which runs precisely because nobody is there.


**A host with several monitors is watched one at a time, and the picker is a media-protocol
addition alone.** `DisplayInfo` carries a `displays` list and an `activeDisplayId`; the viewer sends
`{"type":"select-display","id":…}` back; the agent restarts its capture there and resends
`DisplayInfo`. **Nothing in the server changed for any of it**, which is the property "the server
relays the media protocol without parsing it" exists to buy — and equally means nothing server-side
would catch the two ends drifting, so `web/test/data/remote_control_mapper_test.dart` and the three
agents' `remote_protocol.rs` tests assert the same JSON from both sides.

Five things about it are load-bearing, and the first is the one that fails on the commonest desk.

- **The encoder must be told to send a whole frame on every switch, explicitly.** `FrameEncoder`
  finds changes by diffing against the previous frame, and two identical monitors — an ordinary
  office setup — are the *same size*, so its own geometry check sees nothing changed and it happily
  diffs the new display's pixels against the old display's, sending only the tiles that differed and
  leaving fragments of the previous monitor everywhere the two agreed. `force_full_frame` is what
  each agent calls; a test in all three pins it.

- **Everything held is released before the pointer space moves.** A modifier or a mouse button down
  across a switch would otherwise stay down with nothing on either screen to explain it — the same
  invariant `release_all` already keeps at the end of a session, at the one other moment the
  coordinate space changes underneath somebody's hand.
- **Ids are opaque and agent-defined, deliberately.** A `CGDirectDisplayID` on macOS, a one-based
  index into Windows' monitor enumeration, a RandR monitor (or zero for the whole root window) on
  X11, a PipeWire node id on Wayland. The viewer echoes one back and interprets nothing, so there is
  no shared numbering to keep in step; the *label* is built by the agent too, because only the host
  knows that one of its screens is "Built-in Display" or "HDMI-1" — a label composed in the browser
  from a resolution says nothing about two identical monitors. An empty list means "offer no
  picker", which is what an agent from before this sends and what a one-display host sends, and the
  viewer shows the control only where there is a genuine choice.
- **A failed switch never ends the session.** A monitor can be unplugged between the list being
  drawn and the choice being made; the agent logs it, stays on the display it was on, and says so in
  the next `DisplayInfo`. Ending the session instead would cost the administrator a granted session
  and the host's user another consent dialog over a pulled cable. For the same reason the viewer's
  picker is stateless — it shows what the agent last *reported*, never what was clicked.


**How the four backends reach a second display differs completely, and two of them are a crop rather
than a different source.** macOS restarts the ScreenCaptureKit stream against another `SCDisplay`
and moves `InputInjector`'s origin, which the injector already had because `CGEventPost` works in
global points. Windows and X11 both already had a device context or a root window spanning the
*whole* virtual desktop, so a switch is a source rectangle inside it — which is why both offer "All
displays" as an entry of its own and macOS does not. Wayland is the one that has to ask somebody
else; see clients/linux-agent-wayland/CLAUDE.md.

Two platform consequences worth knowing before debugging one. **Windows needed
`MOUSEEVENTF_VIRTUALDESK` and a virtual-desktop divisor together, and either alone puts the pointer
somewhere else** — `MOUSEEVENTF_ABSOLUTE` normalises over the *primary* monitor without the flag, so
coordinates spanning the desktop get squeezed onto one screen. On a single-monitor host the two
rectangles are the same numbers and the whole conversion is the identity, so a wrong one tests
perfectly clean; `input_injection::PointerSpace` is a separate testable type outside the
`#[cfg(windows)]` module for exactly that reason, and its tests use a desktop with a **negative**
origin, which is what a monitor placed left of or above the primary gives. And **the Windows session
helper has to remember which display was picked**, because Windows switching desktops (a UAC prompt,
the lock screen) rebuilds the capture from scratch — a rebuild that passed `None` would quietly drop
the session back onto the primary monitor with nothing to explain it.


**The default display changed on Linux and Windows multi-monitor hosts, and that is deliberate.**
Both now start on the primary monitor rather than the whole desktop: two monitors sent as one
picture are twice as wide for the same 1600-pixel budget, so both arrived at half the resolution of
the one anybody was looking at. "All displays" is one click away, so nothing is lost. macOS never
had the whole-desktop form to lose.


**`ui.Image` and `CGEventSource` both need releasing by hand.** The viewer keeps decoded tiles as
live `ui.Image`s keyed by position rather than compositing to an offscreen surface, so a repaint is a
few `drawImageRect` calls — but each holds a native texture the garbage collector does not account
for, so every replaced or discarded tile is disposed explicitly. On the agent side
`InputInjector::release_all` runs on **every** path out of a session including a dropped socket: a
session that ends while the remote user happens to be holding Command otherwise leaves the Mac's own
owner with Command stuck down, and nothing on screen explaining it.


**A host is reachable only if somebody is logged in**, which is a stronger statement than the Hosts
screen's own status. "Online" there means a check-in within the last interval, up to an hour ago;
reachable here means a per-user agent process holds a socket right now. The Connect button is
therefore offered regardless of status and the *server* answers — with a session already marked
`AgentUnreachable`, which the remote-control screen explains. Disabling the button on a stale status
would hide working hosts.


## Couplings nothing enforces

- **`pty.rs` is one file twice and a third that only matches its shape.** The macOS and Linux copies
  are byte-identical — both reach a PTY through `openpty`, `setsid` and `TIOCSWINSZ` — and `diff`
  should report nothing. The Windows one is ConPTY and shares no implementation at all; what is kept
  identical is the six-call surface above it (`spawn`, `read_available`, `write_all`, `resize`,
  `try_wait`, `terminate`), because the relay loop that drives it is meant to read the same on all
  three. Its `try_wait` is not redundant with the EOF check beside it: a shell that exits while a
  background process still holds the slave open produces no EOF at all, and without it the session
  sits there attached to nothing.
- All three `screen_capture.rs` share their whole "pure half" — `FrameEncoder`, `tile_differs`,
  `extract_rgb` and the tile constants — verbatim. They all feed the same viewer, so the tile grid
  and the full-frame threshold have to agree; the platform half above it is the only part that
  differs, and it differs completely (ScreenCaptureKit, GDI, X11 `GetImage`).
- The three agents' tray glyphs (`macos-agent/assets/menu-bar-icon.png`,
  `linux-agent/assets/tray-icon.png`, `windows-agent/assets/tray-icon.png`) are one file three times:
  a black shape on transparency, which each platform recolours itself — macOS as a template image,
  Windows by tinting it black or white for the taskbar's `SystemUsesLightTheme` at load and on every
  `ImmersiveColorSet` broadcast. A replacement that bakes in a colour or a background breaks that on
  all three at once; `cmp` them after touching one.

## Operating-system facts for the vulnerability assessment

**Two of the three agents report machine-readable OS facts the `operatingSystem` string does not
carry, and the third deliberately reports neither.** Linux sends os-release's `ID` and
`VERSION_ID`; Windows sends `CurrentBuildNumber` joined to `UBR` (`"22631.4317"`, what `winver`
shows as the OS build); macOS sends nothing new, because `sw_vers -productVersion` already puts the
exact version into `operatingSystem`. That looks like a violation of the "change the struct in all
three agents" rule and is not — see `.claude/rules/hand-mirrored-dtos.md`, which states the
exception and why.

**The Windows one is the one to understand before touching any of it.** NVD matches Windows CVEs on
the update *revision*, not the build: `10.0.22631.4317` answers 1355 CVEs where `10.0.22631.6000`
answers 793. `operating_system` carries only the bare build, so a server given nothing else and
assuming `.0` would report nearly every Windows CVE ever filed against a fully patched machine. The
server therefore refuses to assess rather than approximating (`OperatingSystemSubject`), and this
field is what lifts the refusal. Do not "improve" either end by filling in a default.

**Linux reports these rather than having the server parse them out of `PRETTY_NAME`**, because that
string is prose: "Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS", "openSUSE Leap 15.6" and "Alpine v3.20" share no grammar, and
the point release in the first is not a version NVD indexes by. `system_info::os_release_identity`
takes both keys from the *same* file — `/etc/os-release` shadows `/usr/lib/os-release` rather than
merging with it, so taking `VERSION_ID` from the second while `ID` came from the first could pair a
distribution with another's version.

## Linux operating-system packages

**The Linux agent reports its dpkg or rpm inventory, and it is not part of the application
inventory.** `system_info::scan_os_packages` fills `RegisterApplicationsRequest.packages`, a
separate list from `applications`, which the server stores in a separate table. They exist only
so the vulnerability assessment can ask a distribution's own advisories about them: they never
reach the Applications screen, never grow an `upgrade_paths` row, are never offered to the AI and
are never patched. This does **not** make apt or dnf a package manager this system patches
through — that decision is unchanged and is about something else (see "Platform buckets" in
src/CLAUDE.md).

**Source packages, not binary ones, and this is the part to get right.** Distributions track CVEs
against source packages and so does OSV: on Ubuntu 22.04 the binary `libssl3` answers **0**
vulnerabilities while its source `openssl` answers **48**, and `libc6` answers 0 where `glibc`
answers 38. So dpkg is asked for `${source:Package}`/`${source:Version}` — never `${Package}` —
and rpm's source name is parsed out of `%{SOURCERPM}` by stripping two hyphen-separated fields
from the *right*, which is rpm's own filename grammar and the only split that survives a name
containing hyphens (`xorg-x11-server-21.1.13-3.el9.src.rpm`). Reporting binary names would
silently under-report almost everything, which is worse than reporting nothing because the screen
would look clean.

**`${db:Status-Status}` is checked**, because `dpkg-query -W` also lists `rc` packages — removed,
configuration files still present. Those are not installed software.

**`MAX_REPORTED_PACKAGES` (5000) sits below the server's own ceiling (10000) on purpose.** The
package list travels in the same request as the application inventory, so a report rejected for
being one package over the line would take that host's applications down with it. The agent
truncates and warns instead. Raise the server's figure before raising this one, never after.
