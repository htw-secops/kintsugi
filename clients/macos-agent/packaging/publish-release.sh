# Builds the release binary, bundles it with everything a brand-new install needs (config.toml,
# all three LaunchDaemon/LaunchAgent plists, install.sh, uninstall.sh, and kintsugi-mas — the same set
# dist/ has always held as kintsugi-agent-macos-installer.tar.gz), and publishes that one bundle to
# the server.
#
# It does double duty: a human downloads it from the Clients page for a fresh install, and an
# already-enrolled agent's own auto-update check downloads the very same file and just extracts
# the "kintsugi-agent" (and "kintsugi-mas") entries out of it, ignoring the rest (see
# self_update.rs's extraction) — so there's only ever one artifact to build and publish, not two.
#
# The bundled config.toml's enrollment_token is left blank here on purpose: the server rewrites it
# to whatever AGENT_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN currently is on every download by a signed-in administrator,
# not just once at publish time — see AgentPackageArchiveRewriter — so a token rotation never makes
# an already-published package stale, and there's no --enrollment-token flag to remember to pass here.
#
# Publishing straight to a server (the default below, with no --output-dir) requires a signed-in
# administrator: POST /api/agent-packages carries [RequireAdminSession], so on a server with
# authentication enabled this curl needs that session's cookie, passed through PUBLISH_CURL_ARGS
# (e.g. PUBLISH_CURL_ARGS='--cookie .AspNetCore.Cookies=...'). The supported route is --output-dir,
# a GitHub release, and the Clients screen's "Refresh clients", which needs no cookie here at all.

#   packaging/publish-release.sh --release-notes "Fixes the menu bar version label"
#   packaging/publish-release.sh --mas-binary /path/to/universal/mas   # offline; skips the download
#   packaging/publish-release.sh --ad-hoc            # a throwaway build; orphans every TCC grant
#
# Everything it packages is code-signed with the fleet identity when one is reachable — one
# certificate, minted once by packaging/create-signing-identity.sh. That is not packaging tidiness:
# the designated requirement of an ad-hoc signature is a hash of that exact build, and TCC records
# it verbatim, so an ad-hoc package orphans the Screen Recording and Accessibility grants remote
# control needs on every host that installs it, and again on its next self-update.
#
# **The fleet's key lives in this repository's GitHub Actions secrets and nowhere else**, because
# the release job is the only thing that builds the binary hosts install and self-update to. So a
# hand-run publish from a machine that has no such identity signs ad hoc, says so, and carries on:
# what it produces is a package for one server, and the person reading the warning can decide.
# CI, where nobody is reading, fails instead. --ad-hoc says you meant it.
#
# The version published is always this crate's own Cargo.toml version — bump that first. Run from
# a plain (non-root) shell; unlike install.sh this never needs sudo, since it's talking to the
# server over the network, not touching this machine's launchd/filesystem.
#
# CI builds the binary itself — a universal one on macOS, a static musl one on Linux, neither of
# which a plain `cargo build --release` on the build host produces — and has no route to anyone's
# server. So both halves of this script are separable: --binary packages an already-built binary
# instead of building one, and --output-dir writes the tarball to a directory and stops before
# publishing. The tar invocation below stays the single owner of the archive's top-level entry
# names either way, because those names are what self_update.rs extracts by — reimplementing the
# `tar` call in a workflow file would let the two drift apart silently. See
# .github/workflows/ci.yml.

# The archive carries the agent's own copy of mas (https://github.com/mas-cli/mas), which is the
# only thing that can update a Mac App Store app from a script: the server's AppStoreUpgradeScript
# runs /usr/local/bin/kintsugi-mas as root inside the console user's session (see config.rs's
# MAS_BINARY_PATH and the script itself for the whole arrangement). It has to be *our* root-owned
# copy because a root daemon that ran Homebrew's user-writable /opt/homebrew/bin/mas would be root
# for whoever owns that prefix. mas publishes one .pkg per architecture and no universal build, so
# both are fetched, pinned by digest, and lipo'd into one — an arm64-only kintsugi-mas would leave
# every Intel Mac's App Store rows failing with "not installed". Bumping MAS_VERSION means
# re-pinning both digests from the release's asset list (the GitHub API reports them as
# `digest: sha256:...`) and re-verifying `mas update` from a LaunchDaemon, since mas drives Apple's
# private CommerceKit and has broken on macOS majors before. mas 7 needs macOS 13 or newer.
