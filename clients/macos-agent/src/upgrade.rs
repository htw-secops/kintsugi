///   `PackageManagerCommand` row is a bare `brew upgrade ...` for the same reason. That covers

///   than by owner: the inventory reports the manager with no `packageManager` of its own, so on
///   that field alone it reads as an AI-researched row and was queued to the daemon — which

///   same shared script every formula runs (`brew update` is Homebrew upgrading itself — see
///   `HomebrewUpgradeScript` on the server), as the same user.
/// - An **AI-researched** row (no package manager) installs into `/Applications` the way the
///   server's prompt tells it to — replace the bundle in place, or `installer -pkg ... -target /` —
///   and a bundle that arrived by MDM, `.pkg` or any installer that asked for a password is owned
///   by `root:wheel`. Run as the user, the script's `rm` prints `Permission denied` for every file
///   in the bundle and the old version stays; that is what took Ollama down on the fleet's own
///   Macs. The prompt now writes these scripts *for* root (see
///   `AiUpgradePathResearchClient.BuildScriptGenerationPrompt`), so this is also the only context
///   they are tested in.
/// - An **App Store** row goes to root as well, for a reason that is the mirror image of Homebrew's.
///   Since Apple's fix for CVE-2025-43411 the install half of a store update needs root, while the
///   download half needs the logged-in user's store session; the per-user process is one of those
///   and has no way to become the other (its `sudo` has no TTY to answer), whereas root can be both
///   — `launchctl asuser` puts it inside the user's session and `mas` drops to that user for the
///   store half. The server's `AppStoreUpgradeScript` does exactly that dance, and it is written for
///   root: run as the user it refuses on its first line. Recognized by the same name the inventory
///   reports the manager under (`system_info::APP_STORE_NAME`), which is also the string the
///   server's `PackageManagerCatalog.AppStore` keys the row's bucket by.
